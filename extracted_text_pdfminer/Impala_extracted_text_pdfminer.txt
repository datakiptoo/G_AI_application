ESG Report 2023

Introduction Group overviewLeadership reviewsGovernanceOur social performanceOur environmental performanceAppendixWe are pleased to present our ESG report for the year ended 30 June 2023. This report allows us to 
share our achievements and progress towards our sustainability ambitions as we strive to create a 
better future for our stakeholders. 

The financial information in this report has been extracted from 
the annual financial statement for the year ended 
30 June 2023, prepared in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board and the IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (collectively, IFRS). 

We strive to cater for a wide stakeholder audience in the 
interest of transparency and openness and to enhance our 
stakeholders’ understanding of our business. The risks, 
opportunities and outcomes associated with stakeholders 
are dealt with insofar as these relationships could materially 
affect our ability to create value.

About this ESG report

This report is supplemented by our reporting suite, online 
communications and publications, stakeholder communications 
and additional information available on our website. Alongside our 
annual integrated report, this ESG report is intended to provide 
a holistic picture of our environmental, social and governance 
impacts on stakeholder value in the short, medium and long term. 
While our annual integrated report is aimed primarily at providers 
of financial capital, this report is intended for a broader range of 
stakeholders to provide a holistic picture of our impact on value in 
the short, medium and long term.

The report provides feedback on our commitments to ethical 
leadership, corporate citizenship and integrated strategic thinking, 
and shows how our legitimate stakeholder interactions are 
unpacked to provide a broad view of our strategy and 
performance. 

As the ESG disclosure landscape continues to evolve, we intend  
to evolve and refine our approach (in line with best practice) 
over time.

SCOPE AND BOUNDARY
The information in this ESG report relates to the financial year 
1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 (expressed as 2023 or FY2023). 
The report only covers the following operations over which we have 
direct management control and for which we set and implement 
policies and standards (Impala, Marula, Zimplats and Impala 
Canada). The operational performances of our non-managed 
entities – notably Mimosa (Midlands province, Zimbabwe) and 
Two Rivers (Eastern limb, South Africa) – are covered in our 2023 
annual integrated report. 

The only performance data reported in this ESG report associated 
with these entities are fatal injuries and contributions to Group 
scope 3 emissions. 

While we have a material controlling stake in Royal Bafokeng 
Platinum (RBPlat), now Impala Bafokeng, due to the timing of the 
transaction, we have not provided detailed sustainability related 
disclosure on the operation. For additional information, refer to the 
Audited annual financial statements and annual integrated report.

MATERIALITY 
Our annual integrated report and ESG report are informed by the 
principle of double materiality, and therefore, offer a balanced mix 
of information to enable readers to assess matters that could 
impact our ability to create value (inward-focused financial
materiality) – the basis of preparation of the annual integrated 
report, as well as our impact on our stakeholders (outward-focused 
impact materiality), on society, and on the environment – the basis 
of preparation for the ESG report. For more information on our 
material matters, read pages 13 to 15 of this report. 

VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE CODES STANDARDS, 
FRAMEWORKS AND PRINCIPLES 
In compiling this report, we were informed by the broad principles 
outlined in the voluntary JSE Sustainability Disclosure Guidance 
published in June 2022, and continue to work on aligning our 
non-financial reporting to these principles. 

This report is aligned with relevant reporting standards, 
frameworks and best practice, including: 

The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability 
Reporting Standards. The applicable GRI 
disclosures are indicated in the relevant sections in 
this report. A more detailed response to the GRI 
standards is provided in a comprehensive GRI 
response table, available at www.implats.co.za

We support the recommendations of the JSE 
Sustainability and Climate Change Disclosure 
Guidance

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD) Framework

The FTSE/JSE Socially Responsible Investment 
(SRI) requirements

Implats is a signatory to the principles of the

increasing contributions to various United Nations 
Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) through 
our core activities and collaborative efforts are also 
highlighted throughout the report

MEASUREMENT UNITS
Monetary amounts referred to in this report have been expressed 
in South African rand (R), US dollar (US$) and Canadian dollar (C$). 
Where appropriate, and to facilitate comparability, we have 
presented monetary amounts in South African rand (R) equivalents. 

During the reporting period, the average cost of US$1 was 
R17.77 and C$1 was R13.26. 

We have used a total production of 23 883 kilotonnes milled (this 
accounts for tonnes of ore milled at our managed operations) 
(2022: 22 363 kilotonnes milled) and a 6E refined production of  
3 246koz (2022: 3 189koz); this includes production from non-
managed operations to calculate intensity or efficiency ratios 
for water, carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumed. 

Performance data is for the respective financial year (denoted as 
2023 or FY2023 in the report) unless calendar year data is 
specified (denoted as CY2023). 

INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE
The board takes overall responsibility for the integrity of this ESG 
report, reviewing the final report and approving the material matters 
and themes to be included in the report when reporting on the 
various content elements.  GRI 2-5

Nexia SAB&T, a 84% black-owned and 48% black woman-owned 
assurance firm, has provided independent assurance on selected 
sustainability KPIs. 

Nexia SAB&T is joined by Khulagro, a 100% black-owned audit 
firm as a skills transfer beneficiary on this year’s engagement. This 
is to continue Implats’ transformation imperative, which aims to 
give majority black-owned or black women-owned firms exposure 
to non-financial assurance engagements. Khulagro  scope will 
gradually increase over the next three years. Our goal is for Nexia 
SAB&T and Khulagro to issue a joint assurance statement by 
2025.

The scope of this year’s assurance, the selected performance 
information and the independent statement of assurance are 
provided on pages 126 to 129.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
This report contains forward-looking statements regarding the 
Implats operations and its performance prospects. These 
statements involve an inherent level of uncertainty. They do, 
however, reflect our best judgement and estimates informed by the 
board-approved business plans as at the time of publication of this 
report. Within this context, Implats cannot take responsibility for 
updating or revising any forward-looking statements, except as 
required by applicable legislation or regulation.

BOARD APPROVAL
The board is supported by the social, transformation and 
remuneration (STR) committee and other sub-committees and 
acknowledges its responsibility to ensure the integrity of this 
ESG report. In the opinion of the directors, this report 
addresses all material issues and offers a balanced view of our 
sustainability performance and how this relates to our ability to 
create and preserve value for our stakeholders in the short, 
medium and long term. 

This report, which remains the ultimate responsibility of the 
board, is prepared under the supervision of senior 
management and is subject to rigorous internal and 
independent external assurance reviews. The report was 
reviewed and approved by our STR committee and board as 
part of the reporting suite approval process. 

The board acknowledges its responsibility to ensure the 
integrity and completeness of this report. The members of the 
STR committee, on behalf of the board, have applied their 
minds to the report and believe that the information is reliable 
and that it fairly presents the Group’s ESG focus areas. The 
board has unanimously approved this report for publication.

 Prioritised 

We followed the JSE Sustainability Disclosure Guidance by defining materiality in terms of financial and impact materiality, defined as double 
materiality. This involves identifying and prioritising matters that could impact our ability to create value (inward-focused financial materiality) 
for Implats, as well as matters that may impact our stakeholders (outward-focused impact materiality), society and the environment. 

The outcome of this process shaped our suite of annual reports, especially our annual integrated report, this ESG report and our climate 
change report. A three-phased approach to identifying material themes and matters was adopted:

Reviewed our external environment, considering economic factors, PGM markets, the socio-
political environment and access to essential services. We also reviewed peer reports, issues 
identified in the media and global risk registers, and considered issues raised in our stakeholder 
engagement processes, as well as emerging mining trends.

We conducted an internal review of board documents, previous issues reported in 2022, focused 
business areas such as our strategic objectives, purpose, business model, resource allocation, 
stakeholder engagements and interests, risk and opportunity register and KPI targets.

IDENTIFIED

Material matters were identified by considering their impact on each of the key areas of our 
business.

PRIORITISED

Identified material matters were then prioritised and validated according to their impact on Implats’ 
enterprise value and their impact on our key stakeholders.

Introduction Group overviewLeadership reviewsGovernanceOur social performanceOur environmental performanceAppendixMessage from the chairperson of the 
social, transformation and remuneration 
committee

We are confident that, 
through our unwavering 
commitment to integrated 
sustainability thinking, we 
will achieve our objectives 
and drive continued 
success for Implats.

We have thoroughly investigated each accident and implemented 
initiatives to prevent further incidents. Our focus on safety is 
unwavering and we continue to invest in the necessary resources 
and technologies to ensure a safer environment. Our Group CEO, 
Nico Muller, addresses the matter in greater detail in his message. 

SUSTAINING LIVELIHOODS THROUGH AND BEYOND MINING
Our operating environment continues to pose significant challenges, 
especially in southern Africa, which is impacted by persistent political 
and socioeconomic challenges, sluggish global growth, weakening 
local currencies, soaring inflation and interest rates, increased power 
disruptions and failing state-owned enterprises. Despite these 
challenges, we are committed to creating a better future for our 
employees, communities and suppliers. 

This year, Implats provided jobs for 60 344 (2022: 58 557) 
employees and contractors and paid R22.9 billion in wages and 
benefits (2022: R19.8 billion). Our employee share ownership trusts 
(ESOTs) recognise and reward eligible employees and R660 million 
was distributed to eligible ESOT beneficiaries in 2023 and a further 
R545 million paid as a Platinum Bonus. These distributions reflect 
our commitment to sharing the value derived from Implats’ growth 
and success with our employees. 

We increased socioeconomic development spend by more than 
50% year-on-year to R342 million at our managed operations 
(2022: R228 million). Our focus is to deliver projects and 
programmes that will create thriving local businesses and open 
employment opportunities for our host communities, improve 
health and education outcomes, and provide much-needed local 
and regional infrastructure.

We recognise the growing demand from our host communities for 
procurement opportunities, particularly in South Africa, where we 
spent R2 billion (2022: R2 billion) with local tier 1* host communities 
during the year, accounting for 13% of our total discretionary spend 
(2022: 16%). In Zimbabwe and Canada, we allocated R1.2 billion 
(2022: R837 million) and R637 million (2022: R481 million), 
respectively, to local and indigenous communities residing near 
our operations.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION 
Our core principles are firmly rooted in upholding human rights and 
eliminating any form of discrimination based on race, job title, 
position, gender, religion, background or sexual orientation. 

We recognise that diversity, equity and inclusion foster innovation, 
enhance our collective capabilities and increase competitiveness. 
We remain committed to fostering a working environment that 
reflects the Group values to respect, care and deliver in a way that 
enables our people to thrive and contribute to the best of their 
abilities, irrespective of their differences. In 2023, Implats was 
included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for a fourth 
consecutive year, based on its progressive inclusivity policies and 
practices. This index measures gender equality across pillars such 
as female leadership and talent pipelines, inclusive culture, pay 
parity and gender-inclusive policies. 

A notable highlight of 2023 was the progress made in pursuing 
opportunities to introduce additional renewable energy to our 
operations. In Zimbabwe, we commenced construction activities for 
a 35MW solar PV facility, which will be commissioned in 2024. This 
project will abate nearly 60 000 tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent 
annually. In March 2023 Zimplats also entered into a power purchase 
agreement for an additional 50MW of hydroelectric power, increasing 
its renewable electricity mix from approximately 50% to 67%.

In South Africa, we progressed several studies and issued a request 
for proposal for 200MW of wheeled renewable electricity. These 
initiatives will enable us to move towards our stated goal to reduce 
our carbon emissions by 30% (off 2019 as a baseline) and achieve 
our 2050 carbon neutrality target. With our Canadian operations 
already supplied with 100% renewable electricity, the challenge 
remains in South Africa; several project studies are underway to 
decarbonise our operations.

We are proud to report that women represent 
13.4% of our total workforce (2022: 12.5%), 
27.6% at management level (2022: 25.8%) and 
54% of the board of directors (2022: 47%). 
In South Africa, we continued to make progress 
on the proportion of historically disadvantaged 
persons** (HDPs) represented in management, 
which increased to 72% in 2023 from 69% in 
2022. At board level, the representation of HDPs 
is 77% against a Group target of 60%. We also 
continue to advance interventions to recognise 
our LGBTQI+ colleagues. Impala Canada’s 
LGBTQI+ committee meets weekly to safeguard 
our employees’ rights in a safe workplace. 
In 2024, we plan to introduce similar structures 
at our other operations. 

Gender-based violence (GBV) remains a concern in our operating 
jurisdictions. This year, the Group donated R10 million to a GBV 
response fund and pledged a further R1 million as part of a 
Minerals Council South Africa partnership. All our operations have 
rolled out extensive communication campaigns to create greater 
awareness of GBV and we will persist in our endeavours to make 
our communities safer.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
Last year, we introduced the Group environmental strategy,  
aligned with our ESG framework. This provides a roadmap to 
achieving our ambitious goals for 2030, specifically in environmental 
management, water stewardship, energy and climate change, air 
quality management, mine closure and rehabilitation, biodiversity 
management, and the management of mineral residue and 
non-mineral waste.

*   Tier 1 communities at Impala Rustenburg are Royal Bafokeng Nation 
villages, Freedom Park, Seraleng and Meriteng; Tier 1 communities at 
Marula are the four farms on the mine lease area.

**    The term historically disadvantaged person (HDP) refers to any South 
African person, category of persons or community, disadvantaged by 
unfair discrimination before the Constitution of the Republic of South 
Africa, 1993 (Act No 200 of 1993) came into operation. It includes black 
South African (African, Coloured, Indian and Asian) males and females, 
and white South African females.

It is important to ensure that heavy industry 
activities in water-scarce regions minimise 
freshwater withdrawals and increase water 
recycling. We are committed to reducing our 
use of freshwater and improving our rates of 
water recycling and reuse. We increased our 
internal water recycling and reuse targets from 
48% to 54%. This year, 52% of water used at 
our operations was recycled or reused (2022: 
53%). Our goal is to achieve our 70% water 
recycling/reuse target by 2030.

Another highlight of the year was the outcome of the annual review 
by the independent tailings review board (ITRB), which concluded 
that all Group tailings storage facilities are operated safely and 
effectively, have minimal risk to local communities and the 
environment, and meet the applicable local government and 
international standards. See the Environment section of this report 
to read more about environmental stewardship activities. 

APPRECIATION AND CONCLUSION
We thank our employees for their dedication and grit during a tough 
year. By living our values to respect, care and deliver, we drove 
positive change for all our stakeholders. 

We expect 2024 will be challenging, characterised by continued high 
inflation and cost pressures. By using our robust ESG framework as 
the foundation, we will continue to grow a formidable and sustainable 
business, with the resilience to create a better future for the long 
term. This framework aligns our sustainability efforts with our values 
and strategic objectives to enable us to create a positive impact on 
our environment, our communities and our workforce. 

Looking ahead, we remain focused on improving our efficiency, 
adaptability and innovation to ensure we safely navigate the 
prevailing headwinds, harness the opportunities that arise and 
positively contribute to the Group’s ongoing success. 

Given our unwavering commitment to excellence, I am confident we 
will achieve our objectives.

DEAR STAKEHOLDER
We are honoured to present this year’s ESG report on behalf of the 
STR committee.

SAFE PRODUCTION
Safe production remains the Group’s foremost priority with the goal 
of achieving zero harm to the safety, health and wellbeing of our 
employees, contractors and stakeholders. Achieving zero harm is 
not just an aspiration, it is an essential commitment that 
underscores our respect and care for each member of our 
workforce.

Established safety and health policies and 
comprehensive training initiatives aid in fostering 
a culture of shared responsibility and proactive 
risk management. Our increased focus on fatal 
risk control protocols, visible felt leadership 
and mine safety discipline resulted in all safety 
metrics improving during the year. Regrettably, 
five employees were fatally injured at managed 
operations in 2023 (2022: seven) and one at the 
non-managed joint venture, Two Rivers.

ESG Report 2023

Introduction Group overviewLeadership reviewsGovernanceOur social performanceOur environmental performanceAppendixGroup CEO statement

The Group has well-documented policies, practices and initiatives 
in place to improve safety performance and achieve our vision of
zero harm.

SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELLBEING
We continue to place a stringent focus on safety, aiming to embed 
a culture of zero harm and inculcate individual accountability to 
eliminate high-risk conduct we aim to achieve our target of 
eliminating all fatalities and injuries.

Tragically, we lost five colleagues in fatal incidents at our managed 
operations and one colleague at our Two Rivers joint venture 
operation. On behalf of the board and the executive committee, 
I extend our deepest condolences to the families and colleagues of 
those who lost their lives. We provide comprehensive support to 
the families of the deceased through our We Care programme, 
which includes extending employment opportunities at Implats for 
family members, and ongoing financial aid for the education of the 
deceased’s children. We maintain regular contact with the families 
of the deceased to monitor their wellbeing and demonstrate 
our support.

During the 12 months to end June 2023, the Group’s fatal injury 
frequency and lost-time injury frequency rates improved by 29% to 
0.040 and 7% to 3.92 per million man hours worked, from 0.056 
and 4.21 achieved in 2022, respectively. The total injury frequency 
rate improved to 9.25 (FY2022: 9.76). We continue to encourage 
employees to report all work-related injuries.

Encouragingly, 13 out of our 18 operations achieved significant 
safety milestones, concluding the year on millionaire and  
multi-millionaire status in terms of fatality free shifts. Our sincere 
appreciation is extended to the teams involved who showcase how 
collective dedication can drive us towards eliminating fatalities and 
achieving zero harm.

I am also pleased to report our progress relating to the 
management of HIV/Aids and TB, the incidence rates of which 
have improved year-on-year. Our goal is to completely eradicate 
Aids-related fatalities among our active employees by 2025. For 
the period under review, Aids deaths in service dropped to four 
(2022: 15), the Group TB incidence rate was 226/100 000 people, 
57% lower than the South African national average, and we had 
the honour of hosting the 2023 World TB Day in the mining 
industry. Guests included officials from the International Labour 
Organization, the South African Department of Health, the South 
African National Aids Council, organised labour movements and 
the Minerals Council South Africa. 

KEY DEVELOPMENTS 
In 2022, Implats committed to a five-year, R50-billion capital 
investment programme to extend life-of-mine at several of our 
operations, increase beneficiation capacity, ensure regulatory 
compliance, strengthen energy security and progress the Group 
towards achieving its decarbonisation targets. These investments 
also contribute to securing meaningful employment and 
entrenching southern Africa’s status as a stable and sustainable 
global PGMs-producing region to support enduring benefits for 
all stakeholders.

At Zimplats, we are progressing the smelter expansion and the 
project to install sulphur dioxide (SO2) abatement technology to 
mitigate air quality impacts. Together with the operation’s 
US$37 million 35MW solar PV project, outlined in the message 
from the chair of the STR committee, the SO2 abatement plant will 
result in an industry-leading environmental footprint for the 
Zimbabwean smelting facilities. 

Successful engagements with stakeholders 
aided in concluding our acquisition of Royal 
Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat). As highlighted in 
my message last year, this transaction has the 
potential to transform the outlook of our key 
Western Limb assets at Impala Rustenburg 
and sustain much-needed employment in 
the region.

It will secure jobs and create sustainable socioeconomic benefits 
for the region and its communities, and create sustained direct and 
indirect benefits for the various industries and stakeholders supported 
by the mining activities in the greater Rustenburg region. Our work 
to fully integrate RBPlat into the Group is continuing apace.

I invite readers of this report to take note of Implats’ integrated 
approach to social performance and environmental management, 
which aims to improve the wellbeing of our mine-host 
communities, deliver robust local community infrastructure 
projects, provide education support and uplift local skills, and 
minimise our environmental footprint. Our thriving tailings remining 
project at Impala Rustenburg is but one case study on this 
integrated approach, with a local company contracted to remine 
the old tailings facilities, ultimately rehabilitating the site to usable 
community land. We also take note of increased stakeholder 
sentiment for greater transparency and the need for multi-
stakeholder validation of responsible mining practices and 
performance. To this end, the Group has committed itself to 
conduct an Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) 
audit at a managed site by 2025. We will report the progress of our 
IRMA journey as we proceed.

In closing, I acknowledge the invaluable Group-wide efforts to 
bolster our resilience and sustainability, all in pursuit of our purpose 
— to create a better future — which would be unattainable without 
the support of our dedicated team. I extend my gratitude to all our 
employees for their collaborative contributions and unwavering 
commitment to cultivating an Implats culture that aligns with our 
purpose and paves the way for a prosperous future.

Nico Muller 
Group CEO

We continue to deliver 
substantial benefits 
to our employees and 
communities through 
our integrated social and 
environmental programmes. 

As a responsible global corporate citizen, our goal is to foster 
mutual respect with our stakeholders and, where required, deliver 
practical solutions that offer the greatest possible social and 
economic impact. We achieve this through our values-driven 
corporate culture, which seeks to encourage all employees and 
contractors to take accountability for their actions and mitigate 
challenges for the greater good. 

We recognise the need for a just transition and, as such, our 
clean energy initiatives are geared to improving the long-term 
sustainability of the Group and the communities in which we 
operate. As a PGMs producer, it is pleasing that our products play 
an increasingly important role in providing the materials required 
for the transition to a low-carbon economy. We take a proactive 
and pragmatic approach to understanding the business and 
strategy impacts of climate change and are working hard to mitigate 
its effects on our operations and surrounding communities. 

In acknowledgement of our ESG management 
and efforts, it is pleasing to report that we 
maintained or improved several significant 
external rankings from prominent global and 
regional agencies. Notably, we maintained our 
MSCI ESG ‘A’ rating, and achieved our second 
consecutive inclusion in the S&P Global 
Sustainability Yearbook (2023), a distinction 
reserved for top-performing companies.

our increasing contribution to the attainment of UN SDGs, 
supported by our core activities and collaborative efforts to build 
thriving communities. Constructive and beneficial relationships 
with mine-host communities and sustainable socio-economic 
development remain priorities for the Group and its leadership.

We recognise our collective responsibility to participate in 
transitioning to a low-carbon world and decarbonising the energy 
system to reduce emissions, and supporting safe communities 
through broader environmental stewardship. Our low-carbon 
transition strategy guides our decarbonisation efforts, strengthens 
energy security and positions the Group in the new energy 
value chain.

HOW WE CREATE CHANGE

The Group’s value-
focused strategy aims to 
increase our exposure to 
low-cost, shallower, 
mechanisable production 
over time, repositioning the 
business as a high-value, 
sustainable, profitable and 
competitive metals 
producer. 

Longer term, the strategy 
aims to evolve with the 
world in which we operate, 
growing our exposure to 
above-ground supply, 
incubating new high-value 
business opportunities and 
transitioning into alternative 
high-value future-facing 
(green) commodities. 

OUR ESG FRAMEWORK

In delivering on our purpose to create a better future, our sustainable development aspirations are captured in 
our ESG framework. The long-term goals which guide our increasing contribution to the attainment of the 
UN SDGs are supported by our core activities and collaborative efforts to build thriving communities. 

This work builds on our longstanding commitment to the UN Global Compact and its 10 principles, responsible product stewardship, and 
alignment with industry best practices, including those of the International Council on Metals and Mining.

Introduction Group overviewLeadership reviewsGovernanceOur social performanceOur environmental performanceAppendixOur support of UNGC principles 

The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) is a voluntary global initiative that addresses human rights, labour, environmental and corruption 
issues through a commitment to 10 principles derived from authoritative sources of international law, such as the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, the core declarations of the International Labour Organization, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and 
the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Implats became a signatory to the UNGC in July 2008. The following table provides a 
brief overview of our implementation of the 10 principles.

Our commitment to human rights is described in our human rights policy which 
commits us to fully comply with applicable legislation in the regions in which we 
operate, as well as to implementing the human rights principles in the UNGC. Our 
Harassment, Bullying and Victimisation Policy also ensures that every individual, 
including all persons who have dealings with Implats, are treated with dignity and 
respect.

Employees are trained on human rights as part of our compulsory induction 
process. All our contractors are expected to abide by our human rights policy, 
practices, standards and the laws of the countries in which we operate. An 
independently managed channel is available to anonymously report any unfair 
practices and violations of human rights. 

We have an established responsible sourcing policy to ensure our suppliers of 
PGM concentrate do not infringe on human rights at their operations. We continue 
to align our security practices with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights. 

We strive to uphold this principle through our Group-wide human rights policies and 
code of ethics which are compatible with the applicable legislation in our operating 
jurisdictions.

Further reading 
on pages 36 
to 39.

We recognise the right of employees to collective bargaining and freedom of 
association in accordance with all relevant local labour legislation, and we strive to 
provide an environment that fosters open, honest and effective relations between 
management, employees and elected union representatives. 

Further reading 
on pages 58 
to 59.

We monitor labour relations in our operations; monthly labour relations reports are 
submitted from our operations to exco and escalated to the board when necessary.

All our labour is sourced from the open labour market and all employees are 
provided with contracts in accordance with local labour legislation. They are free to 
resign at any time in accordance with legal processes.

Further reading 
on pages 48 
to 59.

Implats does not make use of child labour in any of its operations. 

We monitor and ensure our compliance with the labour legislation in the countries 
within which we operate. 

We have not detected any significant risks pertaining to the use of child labour.

We strive to eliminate discrimination in all forms throughout our workforce and are 
committed to promoting employment equity and diversity. 

Our human resource policies related to diversity, fair pay, gender equality and 
harassment are available on our website.

We integrate environmental management into all aspects of the business, with the 
aim of achieving world-class environmental performance in a sustainable manner. 

This contribution is further enhanced by the role that PGMs play in the move to a 
greener economy. The extent to which we have adopted a precautionary approach 
to managing environmental challenges is reviewed in our ESG report. 

Initiatives aimed at promoting environmental responsibility are outlined in our annual 
ESG report. These include programmes relating to: 
•  Optimising energy usage
•  Promoting sustainable water use
•  Reducing our atmospheric emissions
•  Responding to risks and opportunities brought about by climate change

Implats has a zero tolerance stance on fraud and corruption. 

We require our employees, business partners, contractors and associates to 
conduct themselves in accordance with the Implats code of ethics and our fraud 
policy.

Our ethics policy outlines conflicts of interest, the prevention of dissemination of 
Company information, the acceptance of donations and gifts, and the protection of 
the intellectual property and patent rights of the Company. 

The policy outlines the disciplinary action (including dismissal or prosecution) that 
will be taken in the event of any contravention. 

An independently managed whistleblowing toll-free helpline is in place to facilitate 
the confidential reporting of alleged fraud and corruption.

performance

Our commitment to superior sustainable development and ESG practices was recognised in several 
rankings* by leading global and regional agencies. 

As ESG performance becomes more prominent, institutional investors, asset managers, financial institutions and other stakeholders are 
increasingly looking at ESG factors when making investment and lending decisions – using them to measure and assess our exposure to 
ESG risks and performance in mitigating those risks relative to our peers. It can be hard to know which scores could influence our 
reputation and capital access, since each rating agency has its own methodology; and yet, we recognise that standing still is not an option. 
We, thus, benchmark our ESG performance against our peers who exhibit the global best practice expected by responsible investors. 

Global ESG performance rating agencies evaluate our ESG performance using publicly available information (annual integrated reports, 
websites and media) in line with the JSE Listings Requirements. In 2023, we were again rated by FTSE Russell, MSCI, Sustainalytics, and 
S&P Global.

OUR APPROACH 
The board is cognisant of the sustainability-related impacts that 
affect our operations and support our efforts to mitigate risks and 
exploit opportunities. 

The board, through its committees, gives effect to the Group’s 
sustainability framework, which guides its approach to delivering 
on some critical global issues, as guided by the SDGs, while being 
sensitive to the needs and imperatives in each host country.

The sustainability framework focuses on reducing our 
environmental footprint, achieving our goal of zero harm, having 
meaningful stakeholder engagements and engaged employees, 
and sustaining livelihoods through and beyond mining.

On a quarterly basis, the board is kept abreast of management’s 
efforts to mitigate risk and deliver against our sustainability 
framework. This includes:

EXECUTIVE-LEVEL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUSTAINABLE 
DEVELOPMENT
Sustainable development remains the responsibility of exco. The 
Group executive for sustainable development is responsible for 
developing ESG/sustainability strategy and for reviewing 
performance in terms of the Group’s non-financial indicators, and is 
also responsible for the environmental performance. There are also 
Group executives for each of the following functions: safety and 
health, people and stakeholder engagement. 

MONITORING SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE 
To reinforce the focus on sustainability matters across the health, 
safety and environment (HSE) and STR committees, the chairperson 
of each committee is also a member of the other committee – this 

enhances integrated thinking across the two committees, which 
together fulfil the mandate of a social and ethics committee as 
described in the Companies Act. Both committees have prioritised 
a greater emphasis on developing and monitoring progress on 
immediate and medium-term measurable ESG targets as the Group 
works towards pronounced long-term targets. Exco lends support to 
the board committees.

During the year under review, amendments to the terms of reference 
for the STR committee were made and the annual work plan was 
further aligned with the ESG reporting requirements specific to the 
committee, especially a greater focus on human rights risks. The 
amendments were aimed at reducing the duplication between the 
STR committee and the HSE committee, thus allowing for improved 
focus.

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND EXECUTIVE 
REMUNERATION
To drive greater accountability around ESG, we have incorporated 
ESG-specific performance indicators into the executive-level 
balanced scorecards. 

Sustainability objectives form part of the KPIs against which our 
management’s performance is measured. ESG KPI measures form 
part of our annual (short-term) bonus, with a fatality modifier 
included to moderate bonus outcomes. The CEO’s balanced 
scorecard is linked to his remuneration, and includes ESG KPIs. 

See our Group remuneration report and annual integrated report 
for further details.

Implats believes an ethics-based culture supports good governance.

OUR APPROACH
The board is responsible for setting the direction for ethics in the organisation with its sub-committees approving codes of conduct, ethics 
policies and monitoring focus areas and ethical outcomes.

SUPPORTED BY GROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

 

Our codes of conduct 
We are intolerant of all unethical conduct and committed to 
mitigating all material ethics risks. How we manage ethics forms 
the foundation of the trust we share with our employees and other 
stakeholders. Our approach is to ensure all employees and relevant 
partners behave ethically, showing care and respect for colleagues, 
communities and the countries in which we operate. 

Our code of ethics, anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy, and 
related governance policies guide our employees and business 
partners, contractors and associates. They are expected to 
conduct themselves in accordance with the standards and 
principles enshrined in the code of ethics.  

Our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy aligns with our code 
of ethics, and expressly outlines our commitment in this respect, 
including a statement around giving or accepting of bribes, which 
is strictly prohibited, as is allowing others to do so in our name. 
The policy further prohibits political donations of any kind.  

We use our engagement initiatives as an opportunity to further 
promote ethical behaviour, deter non-compliance and reduce 
exposure to unethical opportunities. We also provide continuous 
training to ensure these policies are widely understood.

In cases where unethical behaviour is discovered, we thoroughly 
investigate the event and institute corrective actions, such as re- 
training or disciplinary action when necessary. 
 
Whistleblowing
Our fraud, corruption and whistleblowing policy demonstrates our 
commitment to shaping an environment that encourages ethical 
behaviour informed by our values and our respect for open and 
honest communication. 

Implats does not tolerate any form of retribution 
or victimisation against those who speak out 
against ethics violations. We adhere to section 
159 of the Companies Act with regard to 
whistleblower protection and have mechanisms 
in place to ensure that whistleblowers are 
protected.

The toll-free ethics hotlines in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Canada 
are managed and operated independently and are available to all 
our employees and external stakeholders to report concerns about 
potentially unethical, unlawful or unsafe conduct or practices in a

Ethics outcomes
In 2023, 177 cases (2022: 147 cases) were reported across the Group, a 20% increase year-on-year, primarily due to an increase in conflict 
of interest and corruption and fraud and theft cases; 139 of the 177 cases related to the South African operations. 

In South Africa, 51 of the 139 cases were reported through the whistleblowing hotline, compared to 23 cases in 2022. 

There was one case of sexual harassment, tribalism and victimisation (2022: four) and one of racism and sexism reported across the Group. 

All reported cases are investigated. Where allegations are founded, consequence management is applied, including disciplinary proceedings 
which may lead to the dismissals of employees or contractors.

Respecting human rights

We remain committed to upholding the human 
rights and the dignity of every person involved 
in our business, as demonstrated through the 
integration of human rights risk management 
into our business processes and code of ethics. 

Our code of ethics outlines our approach to human rights and 
supports our intention to make sustainability an integral part of 
our day-to-day operations. We also use engagements with our 
employees, communities and other stakeholders as opportunities 
to measure our human rights impacts, and report on our 
performance. 

We uphold the basic human rights enshrined in the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) in our workplace by implementing fair 
employment practices. Our policies and processes ensure 
observance of human rights, including fair pay, the right to freedom 
of association and collective bargaining, the eradication of child 
and forced labour, and non-discrimination. 

Our human rights policy:
•  Complies with legal obligations 
•  Forbids physical abuse, sexual or other harassment and verbal 

abuse or other forms of intimidation 

•  Forbids the use of child, compulsory or forced labour
•  Prohibits discrimination based on race, gender, colour, ethnicity, 
age, religion, political and sexual orientation, union membership, 
physical disability or HIV/Aids status

•  Promotes freedom of association 
•  Strives to ensure a safe and healthy working environment.

Human rights training
Our employees and contractors receive training on human rights 
as part of their induction process, and we maintain awareness 
through various communications initiatives with employees.

Community issues pertaining to human rights are addressed in 
community forums. Community members are also encouraged 
to report any human rights violations to the Company through 
the Group’s anonymous ethics hotlines. 

HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENT

A high-level Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) was conducted in 2022 to help Implats identify issues 
likely to be encountered in the metals and mining sector that have actual or potential human rights implications. 

Implats engaged independent human rights consultants to conduct a high-level HRIA. The HRIA was aligned with the requirements of 
the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and led to the development of a dashboard highlighting areas of potential human 
rights risks.

The Group’s practices and policies to mitigate human rights risks across the five categories in the dashboard are highlighted in the 
various sections in this report. Among others, initiatives advanced in 2023 include continued implementation of our safety, health and 
wellbeing strategic frameworks to address fatal incidents and occupational and non-occupational health risks; a comprehensive gap 
analysis between our current security practices and the latest requirements of the United Nations Voluntary Principles for Security and 
Human Right (UNVPSHR); our responsible sourcing certification for platinum and palladium; our pilot ESG risk verification process for 
broader supply chain; the development of a comprehensive grievance mechanism for our stakeholders; the implementation of rigorous 
tailings management standards; and the implementation of water and air quality improvement projects. 

In 2024, we aim to:
•  Create a human rights working group to coordinate identification and uniform management of human rights issues across the business
•  Ensure that corporate leadership and relevant operations specialists are adequately trained on human rights, leveraging our 

membership to the UNGC

•  Ensure that corporate leads responsible for key human rights themes are sufficiently capacitated with tools and systems to integrate 

human rights risk management tools in their respective themes

•  Progress our UNVPSHR gap analysis
•  Continue our focus on eliminating fatal injuries and occupational and non-occupational health risks

This approach will ensure that we build on the solid foundation created to systematically manage human rights risks and expectations 
and ensure that our people, systems, policies and tools for a detailed human rights assessment.

SECURITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Security-related issues pose an ever-present risk to the protection 
of human rights and can impact our business and the broader 
community. Following the Group’s HRIA, Implats initiated a 
comprehensive gap analysis with an independent consultant to 
identify any shortcomings between security practices and UNVPSHR. 
The work is expected to be competed in 2024 and will help mitigate 
the risk of potential human rights violations in the unlikely event that 
our security personnel have to respond to unrest or illegal activity 
at our operations. The Group’s head of security is responsible for 
ensuring that our practices align with the UNVPSHR. 

Across the Group we employ 10 professionally certified security 
personnel in permanent positions and 1 282 independent 
contractor security personnel. We continue to work on enhancing 
relations with the South African Police Service (SAPS) and manage 
our own security response to avoid any unmanaged escalation of 
conflict. 

In Zimbabwe and Canada, we work closely with local authorities 
and the risk of civil unrest or protest action towards our operations 
is low. No incidents of human rights violations relating to our 
security practices were reported in 2023.

Responsible resettlement

Recognising that any displacement and 
resettlement as a result of our activities would 
be complex and sensitive, Implats avoids 
involuntary resettlement and seeks suitable 
alternative solutions. 

We adhere to a respectful process that is guided by the applicable 
laws in our operating jurisdictions and supported by the Implats 
resettlement policy. We fully consider social and economic 
elements of resettlement, and we are respectful of the communities 
involved and their concerns. 

When unavoidable, in South Africa, we follow the Mine Community 
Resettlement Guideline, 31 March 2022 as published under the 
Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 2002, as well 
as accepted international best practices as contained in the World 
Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12) – Involuntary Resettlements, 
April 2013 and the International Finance Corporation’s Performance 
Standard on Environmental and Social Sustainability, released and in 
operation from 1 January 2012.  

Land resettlement in Zimbabwe is rooted in the Constitution. Every 
person has a right to property, subject to the provisions of section 
72 of the Constitution. The main piece of legislation that speaks to 
resettlement of persons is the Land Acquisition Act (Chapter 
20:10), which is administered by the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, 
Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement.

In Canada, we adhere to all federal and provincial requirements for 
engagement with indigenous communities, which includes, but is 
not limited to, fulfilling all foundational requirements for duty to 
consult (federal), as well as specific engagement and consultation 
requirements for exploration, environmental stewardship and 
monitoring and permitting (provincial level). 

In 2023, Implats completed the resettlement of families residing 
in the zone of influence of the Selous Metallurgical Complex 
(SMC) at Zimplats. The resettlement was conducted in line with 
Zimbabwean law and involved extensive engagement been 
Zimplats, government and the affected families. See page 116 for 
a detailed account of the resettlement. 

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
Implats understands the need to be transparent about how we 
procure goods and services, manage sustainability risks, and 
ensure sustainable practices relating to human rights and 
environmental stewardship in our supply chain. 

Our sourcing philosophy is driven by our values and purpose, and 
strengthened and supported by our code of ethics, the Group 
procurement policy, our supplier code of conduct, as well as the 
Group platinum and palladium responsible sourcing policy, which 
all provide a robust framework to steer our business partners in 
terms of our expectations. 

We have an established a responsible sourcing committee to 
screen new suppliers for platinum and palladium. This committee 
sits quarterly to evaluate new suppliers. 

GRI 308-1

CERTIFICATION
We continue to meet all the requirements of the London Platinum 
and Palladium Market’s (LPPM) Responsible Platinum and 
Palladium Guidance and have been certified by the LPPM. Our 
responsible sourcing policy as well as our latest LPPM responsible 
platinum and palladium certificate are available on our website. 

The London Metals Exchange (LME) has introduced the 
requirements for responsible sourcing certification for a range of 
metals, above and beyond the LPPM certification of platinum and 
palladium supply chains. We are working towards achieving LME 
responsible sourcing certification during the next year in relation to 
nickel and other base metals.

To date, none of the companies (and third parties) from which we 
source platinum and palladium have failed our responsible sourcing 
requirements. 

SUPPLY CHAIN ESG RISK VERIFICATION

In 2023, we progressed a pilot study at Impala Rustenburg to assess our broader supply chain against ESG risk. 
With the assistance of a third party, a verification process was conducted to evaluate the ESG compliance of select 
suppliers rendering services to Impala Rustenburg.

Twenty critical suppliers from Impala Rustenburg were selected, 
representing 21% of the operation’s discretionary spend, to 
participate in a pilot project. All suppliers were asked to 
complete a self-assessment questionnaire that focused on 
87 ESG and legislative compliance criteria. The questionnaire 
required suppliers to disclose their environmental, social and 
safety policies and practices as well as compliance with relevant 
labour and B-BBEE requirements.

In total, 19 responses were received from the sampled 
companies, with one company unresponsive. These were 
evaluated against Implats’ requirements as stated in our 
supplier code of conduct, code of ethics and environmental 
and other policies. Interviews were also conducted with 
supplier representatives. Ten suppliers with the highest risk 
rating, including the unresponsive supplier, were selected for 
enhanced due diligence and informed of their partial or 
non-compliant areas and requested to submit additional 
information or corrective action plans. The major area of 
concern (five out of 10 highest risk suppliers) relates 
to legislative compliance, specifically the establishment of 
suitably drafted policies and management procedures 
governing, among others, labour relations and employee safety. 
Two suppliers were also flagged for potential risk with respect 
to B-BBEE compliance. Management will continue to work with 
suppliers to ensure the identified risks are addressed. 

STRENGTHENING INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA 
PRIVACY
Cyber risk is included in our risk register, as it could interrupt 
business activities and/or result in the disclosure of confidential 
information and intellectual property.

We are cognisant of the ever-increasing threat of malicious data 
hacking resulting in breaches of important systems and data. We 
continue to bolster our defences in this respect, and act decisively 
to effectively manage cyber risks and potential impacts, as a result 
of remote working.

The chief information officer and external 
subject matter experts provide in-depth insight 
into information and communications 
technology (ICT) governance, and cybersecurity 
developments and trends. 

These equip the committee with its oversight 
and decision-making to strengthen Implats’ ICT 
and cybersecurity posture, reduce associated 
risks, and protect its assets and reputation from 
cyber threats. 

During the year, we performed a full analysis of the potential safety 
and production impact a cyber breach could have on our critical 
operational technology systems, with pleasing outcomes.

Our protection of personal information policy guides our approach 
to processing, using and storing personal information to ensure 
data integrity and confidentiality is secured. The policy aligns with 
the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA).

Introduction Group overviewLeadership reviewsGovernanceOur social performanceOur environmental performanceAppendixStakeholder engagement

Our stakeholders are vital participants in our mutual value-creation process. Stakeholders are defined 
as those individuals or groups which have interests that are or could be impacted by our activities and 
decisions.

OUR APPROACH
Companies like Implats do not exist in isolation. To succeed in the 
long term, our board builds and maintains successful relationships 
with a wide range of stakeholders. These relationships contribute 
to our success and endure, if based on respect, trust and mutual 
benefit. 

Accordingly, Implats’ culture promotes integrity and openness, 
values diversity and is responsive to the views of shareholders 
and stakeholders. By identifying the Group’s stakeholders through 
engagement and considering stakeholder interests, needs and 

expectations, our board and management achieve stakeholder 
inclusivity and contribute value to both the business and its 
stakeholders.

Implats recognises that inclusive stakeholder engagement 
underpins our approach to respecting and responding to their 
legitimate needs and concerns, which is essential to creating 
sustainable value over the short, medium and long term. Strong 
stakeholder relations also advance the SDG 17 goal which 
emphasises collaboration, and is a critical catalyst for achieving the 
other SDGs; and it enables stakeholders to accurately assess our 
performance and prospects.

Our overarching stakeholder-centric system assists our operations

At an operational level, stakeholder engagement has a direct 
reporting line to each operation’s chief executive. A module on 
stakeholder engagement is included in our leadership development 
programmes to enhance management capability. 

Management and stakeholder training on the platform is planned for 
2024. Plans are also in place to conduct a detailed perception 
survey on the quality of relationship with stakeholders. Plans to 
conduct the survey, as reported in last year’s reporting, were put on 
hold to allow management to focus resources on establishing 
a complaints and grievance management mechanism. 

This year also saw our executive team undertake its first ESG 
investor roadshow to select institutional investors in Cape Town,

report), our remuneration practices (covered in detail in our 2023

(covered on pages 77 and 123 of this report). The roadshow was well 
received and welcomed by our investors, with praise for the strength 
of the executive team and our initiatives.

This year, the Group made substantial progress 
in establishing a Group stakeholder complaints

targeted at employees and communities. 
This platform will be used to report grievances

of corrective measures and, where responses 
are deemed unsatisfactory by the affected 
stakeholders, allow escalation to the next level

Organisational culture

Our desired culture is one in which our people can realise their gifts, develop and apply their talent and 
feel a genuine sense of fulfilment for their contributions in pursuit of organisational goals. 

The Group has embarked on an internal culture change campaign. This programme was initiated at Impala 
Rustenburg’s 16 Shaft and is planned to be rolled out to all operations over the next three years.

CULTURE INTERVENTIONS

OUR APPROACH 
Our goal is to create a working environment where employees are 
safe, feel valued, engaged and equipped with the support and 
necessary resources to perform their duties to their best ability. 
Our Implats Way – Care and Growth programme provides an 
important basis for building on our culture, and has been 
successfully implemented across the Group. 

We aim to build a diverse high-performance organisation rooted in 
safe practices and respect for our stakeholders. To achieve this, 

Embedding our culture

we embed our desired culture through our values and internal 
engagement campaigns where we continue to articulate our 
strategic direction and goals, and outline how we plan to create a 
better future.

We ask our employees to immerse themselves in our culture to 
help us achieve our strategic goals, thereby helping us to create 
value for our key stakeholders. 

This is how we build and drive our culture

We lead from 

the front

We have a game 
plan and know 
how to execute it

We have a shared purpose 
to create a better future 
which underpins all we do 

as a team

We ensure operational 

excellence

The goal is to instil a culture where leaders and frontline supervisors understand their role of developing and empowering employees 
through the provision of growth, means, skills and accountability, and where employees take accountability and endeavour to change 
the circumstances and mitigate challenges for the better. 

The campaign helps empower senior leaders to adopt a coaching approach in how they deal with exceptions and embed the 
management operating system (MOS) based on the principles of care and growth, to understand the leadership deliverables required  
of them and train mine overseers, shift supervisors, miners and support services employees.

The programme has led to improved employee engagement and the adoption of several training and safety management initiatives at 
16 Shaft.

OUR APPROACH
We are committed to creating a diverse, inclusive, transformed 
and equitable workplace. Our goal is for all employees to feel 
included regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, race, 
ethnicity, religion or disability. We actively promote a workplace 
that is supportive, fair, adaptable and welcoming to all. We remain 
committed to creating meaningful transformation through various 
programmes related to employment equity, diversity, inclusion 
and development. Our diversity and inclusion policy outlines our 
expectations in this regard. We also actively develop leaders who 
value the diversity and unique contribution of every 
employee. 

GRI 405-1

Our corporate approach to diversity and transformation remain a 
key component in driving our future fitness. We are conscious that 
much more remains to be done, but we have made good progress 
against our transformation commitments.

GROUP EMPLOYEE PROFILE
Across the Implats Group, we have a workforce of 38 256 
employees (2022: 38 027 employees) and 22 088 contractors 
(2022: 20 530 contractors), with women comprising 13.4% of our 
workforce (2022: 12.5%). The Group workforce breakdown is 
given on page 130

Over the past five years, women representation 
has increased from 10.8% to 13.4%. Our 
aspirational target is 15% women representation 
by 2025. Women representation in management, 
defined as women in middle and senior 
management (excluding exco) has increased 
from 25.8% to 27.6% in the same period.

GENDER DIVERSITY AND MAINSTREAMING

We remain steadfast in our journey to greater 
gender diversity and gender mainstreaming, 
defined as the intentional advancement of 
women in the workplace and the establishment 
of plans and policies designed to give effect to 
this in a sustainable manner.

Gender diversity is a business priority, ranging from setting targets 
to holding leaders accountable for results. The main focus is 
addressing all areas where women are under-represented and to 
close the gender gaps in retaining, hiring, promotions and pay.

The Group supports the initiatives driven by the Minerals Council 
South Africa which include the Women in Mining Leadership Forum 
supported by a Women in Mining task team aimed at promoting 
gender equality in mining. We are a member of both initiatives and 
have taken leadership roles in several task team projects.

Our commitment to gender diversity is reflected in the Bloomberg 
2023 Gender-Equality Index, which recognises companies 
committed to transparency in gender reporting and advancing 
women’s equality in the workplace. 2023 marked the fourth year 
in which we have achieved this status.

Female representation at board level currently stands at 54%, 
exceeding a 50% target by 2023 in our board diversity policy. 
Transformation steering committees and gender equality forums at 
operations are functional and play a critical role in the development, 
implementation and monitoring of action plans for the 
advancement of women and HDPs. 

Our focus remains on the attraction, retention and development 
of women in mining with emphasis on areas where they are 
under-represented. Significant progress was made this year 
with female representation at management levels in the Group 
increasing from 25.8% in 2022 to 27.6% in 2023. This is as a result 
of preference being given to women in promotions and in filling 
vacancies at all operations. 

Our gender commitments
•  Remove all forms of direct and indirect unfair discrimination 

practices and implement gender equity measures 

•  Develop, implement and monitor strategies to assist in 

the advancement of women 

•  Accelerate the recruitment, development and promotion of 

women in occupations and categories where they are under-
represented 

•  Identify and remove employment barriers to accommodate 

members of designated groups

•  Design and implement skills development and supportive 

human resources programmes to empower women 

•  Promote transparency in employment decisions

EMPLOYEE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR WOMEN
We continue to use a range of communication mechanisms, 
covering multiple complementary forms of media, elevating Implats 
to a position of clear employer of choice for women, and targeting 
current and prospective female employees. The narrative focuses 
on the leadership philosophy of care and growth, and our core 
values of Respect, Care and Deliver https://www.implats.co.za/
EVP/pdf/evp-for-women.pdf.
.

GBV AWARENESS AND SUPPORT 
INITIATIVES ARE BEING DRIVEN 
ACROSS THE GROUP

In South Africa R10 million was donated 
to the GBV response fund, with a further 
R1 million pledged as part of a Minerals 
Council South Africa partnership to 
support Thuthuzela Care Centres. 

At Group level, we have conducted extensive internal and 
external communication campaigns to create greater 
awareness of GBV. We also present voluntary self-defence 
training for our employees and support places of safety for 
women and children in our communities. See page 81 for 
more information.

The Group has committed to ensuring a workplace free from 
harassment, bullying and victimisation where employees and 
others dealing with the business, respect one another’s dignity 
and right to equity. Harassment, bullying, and victimisation are 
forms of invasive conduct that infringe on the rights of individuals. 

We have revised our harassment, bullying and victimisation policy 
to align with South Africa’s new Code of Good Practice on the 
Prevention and Elimination of Harassment in the Workplace, which 
became effective on 18 March 2022. We implemented training 
interventions to prevent, eliminate, and manage all forms of 
workplace harassment. To date, 400 employees have completed 
the training, which is ongoing. The ultimate goal is to ensure that 
all employees are aware of the policy and their rights to dignity 
and respect in the workplace. 

MATERNITY LEAVE ENTITLEMENT 

GRI 401-3

Risk occupations 
The maternity leave entitlement for employees who occupy 
risk occupations, and for whom alternative risk-free 
employment cannot be found, was increased from four 
months’ maternity leave to five months paid maternity leave. 

Employees who work in risk occupations, but where 
alternative risk-free employment is found, qualify for five 
months’ paid maternity leave. 

Non-risk occupations
Surface and services employees who are not working in risk 
occupations qualify for four months paid maternity leave. 

In South Africa, 360 women took maternity leave in 2023 
compared to 313 in 2022, with 1% leaving the Group at the 
end of their maternity leave (2022: 5%). In Zimbabwe, 100% 
of women returned to work after maternity leave in 2023. We 
look forward to welcoming back employees currently on 
maternity leave, set to return in 2024.

CREATING AN INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE THAT IS FREE FROM BULLYING AND HARASSMENT

Implats believes that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace.

ACKNOWLEDGING OUR LGBTQI+ COLLEAGUES

We continue to advance interventions to recognise our 
LGBTQI+ colleagues. Impala Canada has an established 
LGBTQI+ Committee which meets weekly to ensure our 
employees’ rights in a safe workplace. In 2024 we plan to 
introduce similar intervention at our other operations. 

Talent attraction, retention and 
development

Our performance and long-term success are 
directly linked to the skills we attract, thus our 
ability to identify talent, recruit them and then 
develop their capabilities is a critical 
component to expanding the Group’s 
organisational capacity to deliver on its growth 
aspirations. 

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Implats paid R22.5 billion in employee wages and benefits 

(2022: R19.8 billion) 

•  The Group distributed a R660 million to employee share 

ownership trusts in South Africa and paid a further 
R545 million to employees as a Platinum Bonus 

•  Our Group employee turnover rate was 7.7% (2022: 7.5%). 

Our goal is to keep overall Group turnover below 7.5%

•  Ongoing implementation of the executive committee 

•  Our leadership development programme continues to yield

positive results

•  Impala Canada and Zimplats initiatives to attract and retain 

critical skills are yielding positive results

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Ongoing challenges with the availability of critical skills in 

host communities

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND

•  Ensure sufficient internal bench strength for our succession 

pipeline 

•  Improve employee retention at Impala Canada
•  Maintain Group employee turnover below 7.5%
•  Sustain established coaching and people management 
programmes to improve supervisory and management 
leadership development

WORKFORCE DIVERSITY BEYOND GENDER
Our employment equity (EE) strategy and action plans are aligned 
with the 2018 Mining Charter targets and intend to foster our 
desired organisational culture. Our operations continue to implement 
our five-year EE plan (2020 to 2024), with senior managers having 
annual EE targets for their departments as KPIs in their performance 
management process. At year-end, our South Africa operations 
had 607 HDPs in management positions (2022: 543), a 2.5% 
increase year-on-year.

EQUAL PAY FOR WORK OF EQUAL VALUE

Our remuneration philosophy or approach does not apply 
race or gender in determining pay levels. We employ third 
parties with actuarial skills to conduct periodic reviews of our 
remuneration framework, focusing on the Equal Pay for Work 
of Equal Value regulations. Where unjustified discrepancies 
are found, our action plan includes steps to not only 
remediate any differentiation but also to review our pay 
practices to determine how the race and gender discrepancy 
originates and to take immediate steps to change the 
practices. The STR committee provides oversight over our 
commitment to equal pay for work of equal value.

OUR APPROACH
In this highly competitive environment, it is critical to retain quality 
skills and position Implats as an employer of choice. We thus 
focus our attention on finding and retaining the right people with 
the right experience, skills and capabilities by offering competitive 
remuneration, HR development, talent management and 
prioritising EE. 

We support our employees by investing in skills development; this 
ensures they remain future-fit and develop their full potential. This 
approach is also integral to our succession planning and 
capacity building. 

All relevant Group-wide policies and procedures relating to people 
management issues are in place, and these, together with our 
practices, ensure that Implats is a fair, equitable and transparent 
employer with a compelling EVP. 

GRI 401-2 

Talent retention
Our employee turnover was 7.2% (2022: 7.1%) for our southern 
Africa operations and 7.7% (2022: 7.5%) for the Group. We 
continue to strive for a total Group employee turnover of below 
7.5% per annum. 

GRI 401-1 

Workforce stability at Impala Canada
Last year we reported that the employee turnover rate at Impala 
Canada (2022: 20.3%) was significantly higher than Group target 
of 7.5%.

The North American labour market has seen increasing 
competition for workers and shifting attitudes towards work-life 
balance post-Covid. Impala Canada operates on a fly-in, fly-out 
model due to the mine’s remote location and many employees 
require flights to get to the site for their two-week rotation. 

The Canadian operation has implemented an aggressive retention 
strategy which includes a retention bonus scheme for all 
employees below manager level, increased employee referral 
scheme payments to encourage networking and recruitment using 
employees’ professional connections, salary increases, bursary 
opportunities for employees and their children, and the expansion 
of the short-term incentive plan to include all salaried positions 
within the workforce. In 2023, the operation took further steps to 
attract and retain critical skills by conducting over 100 interviews 
with employees to hear their views on how to improve their lived 
experience on site. Employees highlighted challenges with respect 
to food options, the lack of social spaces during downtime and 
much-needed improvements to the site’s wifi connectivity. 
Management formed a diverse working group to immediately 
address issues including delivering new recreational areas, better 
communications facilities to allow employees to stay in touch with 
family, instituting feedback surveys on meals served, and healthier 
meal options. The outcome has been a reduction in voluntary 
resignations. 

The annual turnover at Impala Canada has 
improved to 18.3% in 2023 (2022: 20.3%).

Additional details relating to Group employee turnover by region 
are in the accompanying performance tables on page 136.

Building leadership capacity
At a time of rapid organisational disruption, changing organisational 
structures, markets, stakeholder groups and talent scarcity, we 
recognise that it is imperative to develop our leadership capacity 
to deliver on our strategy and support the growth aspirations of 
the Group. 

We have an established executive committee succession plan 
and development processes (including coaching) for internal 
successors. The development of leadership is a multigenerational 
initiative and the primary building blocks for leadership 
development are well placed within the Group.

Talent councils, coaching and mentoring processes are in place 
across the Group, which has aided in succession planning and talent 
mapping. The leadership pipeline within Implats has been developed 
from the ground up and is supported with bursary schemes, 
learnership programmes, graduate programmes, supervisory 
and other leadership development initiatives. 

Talent recruitment and selection
Talent management councils at each operation oversee talent 
management processes, and work to identify individuals for career 
advancement opportunities. This ensures the Group has a pipeline 
of talented internal candidates available for development 
opportunities and succession planning. 

Our succession philosophy gears the workforce 
to meet our short and long-term objectives. As 
part of our talent management processes, there 
is a drive to build our succession, and therefore, 
a focus on development that supports those 
employees identified for further development.

This year, we successfully recruited talent to fill various senior 
technical roles within the organisation. At Group level, this 
includes the appointment of a chief operating officer, chief technical 
officer, and our first female general manager at Impala Rustenburg. 
At operational level, we prioritise recruitment of employees from 
communities close to our operations wherever possible. 

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT PROCESS
Our goal is to enable our employees to thrive while maximising 
their performance. We achieve this by effectively managing 
performance and incentivising behaviour that supports the Group’s 
business goals. The Group’s strategy and business plans are 
cascaded into individual balanced scorecards and goal plans, from 
executive level through to junior management. 

SKILLS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES

Business sustainability depends on having an appropriately qualified and skilled workforce.

We identify talent and develop skills within our organisation and 
in our local communities by working with schools and other 
education stakeholders. 

GRI 404-2

Our learning and development strategy consists of the following 
initiatives to support the business:
•  Adult education and training (AET) provides a conceptual 
foundation to encourage lifelong learning and development

•  Artisan and non-artisan training through learnerships and skills 

programmes at dedicated centres

•  Cadet training programmes develop critical mining skills 

among the youth within our local communities. The cadets 
also receive financial life skills and basic business skills training

•  Coaching and mentoring is offered to all employees across 

different occupational levels

•  Internal graduate development programme for graduate 

interns and experiential learners with preference given to local 
communities

•  Leadership and supervisory training

•  Portable skills training for employees who have been earmarked 

for retrenchment, are permanently incapacitated or are due to 
retire. The programme aims to provide them with the necessary 
skills to seek other employment or to become self-employed
•  We offer bursaries for tertiary education to employees and 

community members.

This year, our South African operations invested R1 billion 
(2022: R865 million) on skills development, representing 4.77% 
(2022: 6.8%) of our annual leviable payroll against our target of 5% 
(as required by the Mining Charter).  GRI 404-1

SHARING SUCCESS WITH EMPLOYEES

In 2023 Implats paid employees R22.5 billion (2022: 
R19.8 billion) in the form of wages and benefits. 

At Impala and Marula, the ESOT distributed R660 million to  
qualifying beneficiaries. A Platinum Bonus of R545 million 
was also paid to employees at Impala and Marula in 
recognition of safe production and strong financial 
performance. The maximum payout to beneficiaries was 
around R10 000 per employee.

Employee relations 

GRI 2-30

Our inclusive employee relations model

Our employees have a right to freedom of 
association and can join a trade union and 
engage in collective bargaining. Through 
collaborative efforts, we have maintained stable 
and constructive labour relations and 
partnerships with unions at all our operations. 

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Positive relations with employees and their union 

representatives were sustained at all operations

•  Wage agreements in place at all operations
•  Wage agreements at Impala Refineries and Zimplats will 
expire in the 2024 financial year. Impala Canada’s wage 
agreement is valid until September 2024 and Impala 
Rustenburg and Marula wage agreements are in place  
until 2026

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Inter-union rivalry among contractors remains a challenge 

at Impala Rustenburg 

•  Two-day work stoppage at Impala Rustenburg in 

September due to a tax-related issue with respect to ESOT 
payments. This was successfully resolved following joint 
intervention from management and the labour union

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND

•  Maintain high levels of employee engagement and 

continuously monitor and seek to mitigate risks related to 
employee relations

•  Negotiate wage agreements at Impala Refineries and 

Zimplats

OUR APPROACH 
Our strategic employee relations objectives are aimed at ensuring 
that our people are treated with respect, care and are empowered 
to raise their concerns through direct communication with the 
Group’s supervisory leadership, as well as through labour relations 
structures of engagement.

Our labour relations policy outlines the freedom of association, 
recognition of unions, and the rights of employees and contractors. 

We strive to meet our employee relations objectives of care through:
•  Empathetic listening and problem-solving and facilitation techniques
•  Expeditious resolution of employee problems by line management
•  Effective and regular communication with employees
•  Demonstrating respect while leading through clear objectives
•  Effectively communicating Company policies, collective agreements 

and following labour laws.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING 
Key labour relations policies and practices ensure that freedom of association and constitutional rights remain protected. We continue to 
promote and ensure compliance with the relevant legislation and regulations. 

At the heart of our labour relations strategy is the strategic alignment of our labour partners with our vision, values and business strategy to 
forge the foundation of collaborative efforts and create a conducive working environment where constructive engagement between Implats, 
organised labour and union representatives can take place. 

We work with recognised trade unions to effectively manage our labour relations. Employees have a right to freedom of association. The 
goal is to continue to strengthen meaningful and constructive communication with union leadership. We recognise all trade unions that 
represent the interests of our employees. Unfortunately, union rivalry is not in the best interest of the Company and employees as it often 
results in threats of or the use of violence.

Inter-union rivalry among contractors remains a challenge at Impala Rustenburg. To mitigate its risks we have a 
multi-pronged strategy for engagement, including with the government and legal entities, which has delivered 
effective results.

Our duty of care and responsibility extends to the relationships between our contractors and their labour unions.

Zimplats continues to experience harmonious employee relations and constructive industrial relations. Regular 
departmental, works council, and quarterly management and work leadership meetings provide the foundation 
for ongoing engagement and communication.

The operation continues to conduct weekly meetings with the United Steelworkers Union, the largest private sector 
union in Canada, to maintain positive and constructive relations. The relationship with the union’s new leadership 
began on a positive note, and the operation looks forward to continued collaboration with the union.

Employee accommodation and living conditions (continued)

At Implats, we pride ourselves on our employee housing projects. The Group has 
consistently gone beyond compliance in providing decent housing and improving 
employee living conditions, investing more than R5 billion in housing and living 
conditions since 2008.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

South Africa

The Group continues to advise industry peers on homeownership 
models and has built truly integrated living options with schools, 
commercial centres and government precincts. 

At board level, risks and opportunities associated with employee 
housing and living conditions are reported annually to the Group 
STR board committee. At executive level, our South African 
operations have a dedicated Group property manager whose 
primary role is to manage the Group’s extensive property 
portfolio and address the current and future housing needs of 
our employees.

Since the implementation of our accommodation strategy in 2008, South African 
operations have constructed 3 923 houses and sold 4 200 houses to employees, 
including existing company houses. 

We provide a living-out allowance benefit to enable employees who do not participate in the homeownership 
scheme to source decent accommodation. 

The majority of our employees are first-time homeowners, and we aspire to help them create wealth through 
property ownership. 

Impala Rustenburg
The value of the homes since the inception of the housing strategy in Rustenburg has increased since 2008. These 
homes were bought at an average price of R265 000 in 2008 and are now valued at R650 000 – this represents a 
146% increase in value over the past 15 years.

We have 4 000 single-accommodation residence units and 308 family residence units available for rental at Impala 
Rustenburg. The occupancy rate at these residences is 80%.

Impala Rustenburg continues to progress its flagship Platinum Village housing scheme with 215 houses built this 
year (2022: 218 houses built). 

Through the Platinum Village development, we continue to support local jobs, with all construction activities carried 
out by local mine-host communities contractors, many of whom have received training from Implats in portable 
skills such as bricklaying, plastering and tiling. 

Marula
Our Marula operation provides various housing options to employees including rental accommodation and home 
ownership. Onsite, the operation has 101 single-accommodation units and plans are in place to build an additional 
20 single units at the camp facility. In 2023, Marula carried out various renovations to its onsite accommodation 
units, including the installation of solar geysers, which has led to an increase in occupancy from 42% to 83%.

Most people employed at Marula live on tribal land adjacent to the operation, and are largely community bound, 
preferring to live close to the mine site. To date, the operation has sold 17 of its 34 free standing housing units 
to employees and in 2023 installed additional boreholes to improve water security at its housing development.

Marula’s housing forum also works to improve living conditions for its employees, through electrification projects 
and drilling boreholes in local communities.

Zimbabwe

The Zimplats employee housing strategy is three-pronged, comprising company 
housing, a home ownership scheme and the provision of stands to employees for 
home construction. 

Zimplats has developed 2 090 houses since 2008 (including associated infrastructure).

The proposed construction of 1 052 employee housing units in Turf Town, Mhondoro-Ngezi, is currently under review 
due to financial constraints. As at year-end, a total of 420 housing units have been handed over for occupation. 
Construction of the remaining 1 052 houses will commence once additional funding has been secured. 

Zimplats continues to make progress with its employee home ownership scheme at SMC. The company is 
assisting beneficiaries of the scheme to secure mortgage finance from local banks. 

Canada

Impala Canada employs 924 people, mostly on a two-week rotational basis. 
Under normal operating conditions, the site averages 500 employees and contractors on-site where they live in 
company-provided accommodation. In 2023, the operation upgraded its on-site housing facilities including 
recreational areas, accommodation units, and wifi and introduced healthier meal options (see page 56). The 
operation does not supply housing for employees outside of the mine site.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Invested R224 million in employee housing and improving 

living conditions in South Africa (2022: R228 million) 

•  Invested R88 million on housing development projects in 

Turf Town (2022: R324 million) in Zimbabwe

•  Marula continued electrification and water supply projects 

to areas where our employees reside. To date, the 
operation has given over 27 000 people access to water 
and electricity within the rural area surrounding the 
operation 

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Water infrastructure challenges and power disruptions from 
state-owned utilities continue to have negative impacts on 
construction activities

•  The construction of employee housing units in Zimbabwe 

is currently under review due to financial constraints

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND

•  Facilitate home ownership and promote greater uptake of 

decent accommodation options to employees

Implats’ housing strategy has run for 15 years 
and has provided decent accommodation and 
wealth creation/home ownership opportunities 
for thousands of employees. We share our 
experience and learnings with industry peers 
to help improve accommodation and living 
conditions for all mine workers. 

OUR APPROACH
We continue to facilitate sustainable human settlements and 
ensure access to decent accommodation for employees residing 
in informal structures.

Our housing projects are designed to minimise environmental 
impacts. All houses are equipped with solar geysers. We also plant 
trees at all our developments and supply boreholes to alleviate 
water stress on municipal sources.

to the ISO 45001:2018 standard by 2024

OUR APPROACH
Our commitment to the safety of all workers is set out in our 
Group-level occupational health and safety policy. Our safety 
strategy drives our operational culture and our vision of being injury 
and fatality free. The strategy is informed by external and internal 
reviews of our safety systems, and through ongoing analysis of the 
root causes of all fatal, reportable, high-potential and lost-time 
injury incidents. 

GRI 403-1

The primary safety risks facing our operations relate to falls of 
ground (FOG), moving machinery, working at height and the 
release of stored energy. 

MEASURING SAFETY 
We measure our safety performance through a combination of 
leading and lagging indicators. We monitor and thoroughly investigate 
all proactive and regulatory stoppage instructions and report 
high-potential incidents (HPIs) at each site to ensure that we learn 
from near-miss incidents. We also measure and monitor the risk 
behaviour and competence in and out of the workplace through our 
visible felt leadership (VFL) interventions, planned task observations 
as well as safety audits. The lagging indicators we report include 
fatal-injury frequency rate (FIFR), lost-time injury frequency rate 
(LTIFR), and reportable and total-injury frequency rates (RIFR and 
TIFR). These are defined on page 67. We share our safety 
performance across all our operations and with industry bodies in our 
areas of operation. Safety indicators (leading and lagging) form part of 
individual, site and Group-level recognition and reward schemes

Our performance against key leading and lagging indicators
The Group’s FIFR and LTIFR improved by 29% to 0.040, and 7% 
to 3.92 per million man hours worked, from 0.056 and 4.21 achieved 
in 2022 respectively. The RIFR, a measure of more serious injuries, 
improved by 2% year-on-year and has shown a 23% improvement 
over the past five years. Further, 13 of the Group’s operations 
achieved millionaire or multi-millionaire status in terms of fatality-
free shifts. 

Against this backdrop, we are saddened by the occurrence of 
five fatal incidents over the past financial year at our managed 
operations; these occurred at Impala Rustenburg and at Zimplats. 
The details of these fatal incidents, as well as a summary of 
remedial actions and learning points are on page 65.

Ensuring the safety of 
our employees and 
contractors underpins 
       
everything that we do and 
  
remains fundamental to 
delivering on our commitment to zero harm.

INVESTIGATIONS AND REMEDIAL ACTIONS 

Tragically we lost five colleagues in fatal incidents this year. We extend our deepest condolences to the 
families, friends and colleagues of those who lost their lives, and we offer ongoing support to their families.

We thoroughly examine the root causes of each fatal incident, which includes operational executives conducting in-depth investigations 
to identify culture and leadership failures at the operations, as well as appointing third-party investigators to independently determine 
root causes of fatal incidents.

All investigations relating to fatalities are presented at both executive and board level, and remedial action is taken to prevent repeat 
occurrences.

Investigations this year showed that the major contributing factors to the fatal incidents were due to a disregard of safe production 
rules, inadequate design or training, and breaches in critical safe behaviours.

Fatal incidents in 2023

Remedial action and learning points

On 15 September 2022, Estevao Matsimbe, an electrical 
serviceman, at Impala Rustenburg’s 16 Shaft was fatally injured 
when a suspension chain broke and caused a pipe column to fall 
on him.

On 20 December 2022, Lydia Gore a general hand at Zimplats’ 
Bimha Mine was struck by a falling object and succumbed to her 
injuries while receiving medical attention at a local hospital.

On 16 January 2023, Abraham Mofokeng, a scraper winch 
operator at Impala Rustenburg’s 16 Shaft, suffered serious injuries 
when an explosive detonated in his area of work. Mr Mofokeng 
subsequently passed away on 4 February 2023 while receiving 
medical attention.
On 8 February 2023, Henry Raki, a team leader lashing at 
Zimplats, was working to expose lifters in preparation for the 
charging process to commence on one of the roadways when 
a rock wedge dislodged and fatally struck him.

On 13 March 2023, Thembile Ngqanji at Impala Rustenburg’s 
20 Shaft was drilling shot holes while positioned outside of aerial 
coverage of the safety net. A rock dislodged from the hanging 
wall and fatally injured him.

The remedial actions undertaken include an audit of all workshops 
aimed at identifying and fixing similar hazards, auditing redundant 
pipe columns in walkways, enhancing pipe network suspension 
and the review and amendments to shaft-specific standards. 
Impala Rustenburg engaged a third-party service provider as part 
of the existing corrosion mitigation strategy.
The key remedial actions include consequence management for 
failing to enforce standards and procedures, team restructuring 
to balance different experience levels, retraining of staff, initiatives 
to improve contractor availability as well as the review of medical 
care oversight and capacity.

With the number of expansion projects in place across the 
Group, management ensures that adequate change 
management processes are in place, with lessons shared.
Communication was issued on the mine informing employees that 
only miners are permitted to remove explosives from a shot hole. 
A further communication was issued to all miners on “Unauthorised 
handling of explosives”. All miners were retrained on correct 
marking and charging up of explosives.
Key remedial actions include an increase in the visible felt 
leadership (VFL) approach from management; ensuring that the 
mechanical rock scaler is mandatory in FOG management; a FOG 
indaba took place with group rock engineers to assist 
management in identifying any shortcomings or deficiencies in the 
operation’s FOG management; and conducting a safety culture 
maturity assessment.
A review of ledging procedures to ensure they are aligned with 
industry best practices; implementation of an empowering 
supervision approach to promote safe behaviour among 
employees.

SUMMARY OF PERFORMANCE AGAINST KEY LEADING 
AND LAGGING INDICATORS 
Key leading indicators 
•  In South Africa, Section 54 stoppage instructions are issued by 

GRI 403-2

the regulator in areas where dangerous conditions/non-
conformance are observed. The total number of regulatory 
stoppages increased by 53% to 92 (FY2022: 60) 

•  Our proactive management-led internal stoppages, VFL 

interventions and planned tasks continue to positively contribute 
to building a safety culture 

•  Safety-related training extends to our workforce in various forms, 

from formal training initiatives to regular safety briefings 

•  All new employees and contractors are also required to undergo 
safety induction training. Year-on-year, there was a 8% increase 
in induction training and a 24% increase in safety representative 
training interventions

•  Our operations manage road safety by means of road behaviour 
checks and alcohol breathalyser tests and implement road safety 
campaigns to reinforce safe behaviour outside of the workplace. 
Incidents of non-compliance remain low

CARING FOR OUR FAMILIES
In all fatalities that occur at our mines, we offer support to 
the respective families, which include the various workmen’s 
compensation funds, specialised trauma counselling for 
dependants and counselling for co-workers, Group insurance 
cover for funeral expenses, and a benefits pay-out to the family 
according to the rules of the respective funds.

We also offer employment at Implats for a family member, and 
provide ongoing financial assistance for the education of children 
of the deceased (from pre-school to tertiary level) through our 
We Care programme. Since 2011, we have spent R23 million in 
sponsoring its beneficiaries. This amount has paid for school fees, 
uniforms, sports gear, educational tours, educational 

psychologists, Christmas vouchers, households visits and extra 
classes for the beneficiaries in need. We maintain contact with and 
visit the families at least once a year to monitor their wellbeing and 
educational progress, and to demonstrate ongoing support.

INDUSTRY-LEADING SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
The majority of our operations (Impala Refineries, Marula, and Zimplats) have obtained ISO 45001 certification. We expect certification for 
Impala Rustenburg and Impala Canada will be achieved in 2024. This will assist our operations to continually improve safety and risk, and 
will ensure a consistent approach. 

QUEST FOR ZERO HARM – MANAGING SAFETY AT ZIMPLATS’ US$1.8BN EXPANSION PROGRAMME

Zimplats is undertaking a US$1.8 billion expansion programme which will bring a significant number of 
contractors to site. The operation aims to maintain its excellent safety performance by ensuring that 
contractors adopt its safety culture. 

Safety is a critical focus area in the rollout of the Zimplats 
expansion programme. Zimplats currently has nearly 
7 000 employees working at the Ngezi and Selous sites, 
with 3 500 of these being contract employees, and 
numbers expected to double over the next five years. 
Zimplats hosted a safety symposium with contracting 
companies to outline its safety culture and expectations. 
Contractors are encouraged to adopt the recognised 
systems at Zimplats, cultivate safe employee behaviour 
and create a workplace environment that promotes safety.

We link safety management KPIs to 
remuneration, which reinforces our approach to 
embedding safety within the Group. 

We have 20 performance management standards that operational 
management and teams continue to be measured against, which 
include a combination of leading and lagging performance 
indicators, helping us embed a Group-wide proactive approach to 
eliminating safety risk. 

Our safety results impact the performance-based remuneration of 
all employees. A personal safety plan and skills development matrix 
has been established throughout all operations. Key individuals 
have been identified for specific safety and risk training, and all 
operational D- and E-level employees have established personal 
safety plans included within the skills development matrix.
 
It is, however, management’s responsibility to continuously evaluate 
employees to identify possible opportunities for improving personal 
growth, competencies and participation in all safety-related 
performance initiatives.

Technical solutions 
A key function of the business improvement teams is to identify 
opportunities to introduce proven technology to improve safety. 
These include, for example, replacing steel tendon units with units 
made of composite materials for use in corrosive environments, 
and the introduction of a tagless system for surface construction 
machines to detect people, vehicles and objects outside the 
dedicated high-risk areas. The business improvement teams 
consult regularly with the regulator and other institutions to identify 
new technology and opportunities for implementation throughout 
Implats’ operations.

We proactively manage safety risks with 
operational risk management positioned as a 
key enabler in our safety strategy model. 

Our goal is to continually improve our risk management system. 
We achieve this through researching and benchmarking against 
best practices (industry and international) and against the ICMM 
principles. Any opportunities identified during this process are 
considered to improve our systems and practices. We have adopted 
the optical characteristic recognition (OCR) system, which automates 
daily workplace inspections. It continuously updates workplace 
risk profiles, which are made available to the work teams and 
supervisors, keeping them informed of any changes to workplace 
conditions and potential hazards. This operational risk management 
system is already implemented at our Impala Rustenburg and 
Marula operations. The rollout to all other operations will be 
completed by 2024. 

GRI 403-2

We are focused on implementing proactive 
initiatives and robust, effective controls 
to prevent fatal accidents

MAKING A POINT 

To keep safety at the forefront, employees 
and contractors at Impala Canada complete 
a daily safety card which includes, among 
other things, the five-point safety system of 
the Lac des Iles Mine. 

This is a joint programme run by Impala Canada and the 
United Steelworkers Local 9422 union. 

At the start of each shift, workers provide ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answers 
to five safety-related questions, including ‘is your workplace 
and equipment in good condition?’ Any question answered 
with a ‘no’ requires a hard stop. 

The crew member then corrects the issue or, if needed, flags it 
with the supervisor, who investigates and takes corrective 
action. This daily five-point risk assessment questionnaire is

Health and wellbeing

In support of the Group’s purpose of creating a better future, we aim to ensure that our employees’ 
health is maintained, and that no ill health occurs because of any workplace exposure. 

HIGHLIGHTS

•  The annualised TB incidence rate of 226 per 100 000 
employees remains well below the estimated national 
average of 527 per 100 000 citizens.

•  Impala Rustenburg hosted the Mining Industry World TB 

Day commemoration and showcased its world-class 
TB management programme

•  Impala Rustenburg partnered with a local non-profit 

organisation, Tapologo, to train 60 home-based care givers 
to screen for TB, voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) of 
HIV and general health education for communities

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  The South African mine industry’s health milestone target 
for zero NIHL cases by 2024 is unlikely to be met by the 
industry. This is because of a delay in phasing out 
equipment with noise in excess of 108dB and the 
suspension or reduction of hearing screening programmes 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

•  Four employees passed away from HIV-related illnesses 

(2022: 15 HIV-related deaths)

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND

•  Enhance Implats’ medical services efficiencies
•  Maintain Group TB incidence rates below national averages
•  Increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake and reduce 

Aids-related deaths to zero by 2025 

•  Introduce a wellness programme to enable fitter and 

healthier employees

OUR APPROACH 
Our vision for employee health is for our people to be healthier 
and physically and mentally fitter than they were before they joined 
Implats. 

While the Group is responsible for the occupational health of our 
employees we share the responsibility for non-occupational health 
with our employees and provide access to quality, affordable and 
private healthcare. This service is delivered through the Group’s 
clinics and medical facilities as well as through a range of medical 
aid and insurance options. 

We mitigate exposure to potential health hazards in the workplace 
to levels below those known to cause harm and to prevent 
associated occupational diseases. Where there is a possibility that 
an occupational exposure limit might be exceeded, we investigate 
and implement suitable controls, including the provision of 
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). 

All PPE adheres to stringent standards, which also considers the 
specific requirements for women. All employees are required to 
have an annual occupational health fitness assessment, which 
includes x-rays, audiometry, lung function tests and a medical 
examination. This ensures all medical conditions that our 
employees may not be aware of are detected, diagnosed and 
treated early. Our common lifestyle-related health risks include 
obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and HIV/Aids. 

Robust wellness programmes are in place and we conduct voluntary counselling and testing campaigns on a regular basis where 
employees can get checked for these chronic conditions.
 
We also recognise the importance of a good work-life balance, without which additional strain is placed on individuals with negative 
implications for their physical and mental wellbeing. 

Health education forms a cornerstone of the wellness programme and our monthly health topics provide employees with insights into 
specific health issues, which are then supported by our healthcare workers in our Group medical facilities. 

GRI 403-3 

Our strategy addresses occupational and non-occupational health and is structured around three main pillars:

Employee Health
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH 
Our approach is informed by occupational health milestones for the South African mining industry, which include targets for HIV/Aids, TB, 
silicosis and NIHL. All our operations, including Zimplats and Impala Canada (where applicable and available), are required to achieve these 
milestones as part of the overall Implats health strategy. We continue to cooperate with the industry, through the Minerals Council South 
Africa, in developing programmes and initiatives to reach these milestones.

Our performance

Noise-induced hearing loss
(Assessed and compensated by third party)

•  Eliminate silicosis – 95% of all exposure measurement 

results will be below the level of respirable crystalline silica 
of 0.05% mg/m3

•  Target achieved with no new cases of silicosis and given the 
low silica content in our ore. We continue to screen all new 
employees for early signs of silicosis. Our previously reported 
cases of silicosis all have previous gold mining exposure.

•  Reduce and prevent TB and HIV/Aids – the TB incidence rate 

•  The TB incidence rate at Group level is less than the South 

should be at or below the national TB incidence rate

African national TB incidence rate 

•  Adherence to HIV treatment remains high at above 95%. In line 
with the industry’s aspirations, the Group has committed itself 
to the aspirational targets of 95% of employees undergoing 
awareness training; 95% of employees being tested for HIV/
Aids; 95% of HIV-positive employees on a management/ARV 
programme; and no employee on the HIV management 
programme dying from an Aids-related illness. This is the 
95/95/95 principle approach to HIV/Aids.

•  Eliminate NIHL – total operational or process noise emitted by 

any equipment must not exceed sound pressure level of 
108dBA

•  We are replacing the remaining pieces of rock drilling 
equipment (drills) emitting noise levels above 108dBA

•  Work is underway to replace these with drills of noise levels 

below 102dBA

•  Eliminate coal workers’ pneumoconiosis – 95% of all exposure 

•  No exceedances were recorded for exposure to coal dust in 

measurement results must be below the level of coal dust 
respirable particulate of 1.5mg/m3 (<5% crystalline silica)

our operations where coal-burning activities occur

NOISE AND HEARING CONSERVATION 

NIHL remains the major occupational health 
risk for the Group. 

The South African Mine Industry Health Milestone Targets for Noise 
Induced Hearing Loss cases is zero new cases by 2024, a target 
that the industry is unlikely to meet. This can be attributed to 
delays in phasing out equipment with noise in excess of 108dB, 
inadequate implementation of hearing conservation programmes 
and the suspension or reduction of hearing screening programmes 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

We continue to make progress with re-engineering or replacing 
machines at our operations that emit noise levels above the 
108dBA limit, and we apply a policy of “Buy Quiet” to the 
purchase of all new equipment.

We provide all employees potentially exposed to noise with 
custom-made hearing protection devices. We conduct audiometric 
examinations, which incorporate a standard threshold shift as 
required by the 2024 milestones, to detect early hearing 
deterioration, and where relevant, implement additional corrective 
measures before permanent NIHL develops. 

All employees who have an NIHL shift of more than 10% are 
assessed by an independent third party to determine disability 
and compensation if the hearing loss is deemed to be work-related. 

During the year, we continued to clear the backlog of NIHL testing 
brought about by Covid-19 and 92 previously identified cases of 
NIHL as determined by the Compensation for Occupational Injuries 
and Diseases Act (COIDA) formula were assessed and compensated. 

To ensure that employees remain aware of the danger of noise, 
regular awareness programmes are implemented across our 
operations.

of TB and its associated complications. Contact tracing of all TB 
patients and the close and strict monitoring of treatment remains 
a key focus. No extreme-drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases were 
diagnosed or are currently being treated. The overall Group HIV 
positivity rate is 2.6%.

IMPLATS WORKS WITH INDUSTRY 
PARTNERS TO ELIMINATE NIHL

Implats has worked with the Minerals 
Council South Africa to trial 
electrohydraulic rock drills to help 
address noise related risks associated 
with pneumatic drills that are currently in 
use at operations.

All operations are implementing the 95/95/95 
principle and are achieving their 95% target 
related to HIV/Aids awareness training. 
However, there is room for improvement 
in terms of testing and subscription to the 
HIV/Aids management programme.

Approximately 6 033 Implats employees (2022: 6 109) are currently 
receiving care through our HIV wellness programme. The majority 
are healthy and adhere to their treatment programmes, but require 
close monitoring. This year, we received 620 disability medical 
incapacitation applications for HIV-related disorders, compared to 
423 in 2022. These are employees who present a CD4 count less 
than 200 cells/mm and a viral load greater than a log value of 2. 
These employees have a severely compromised immune system 
and their conditions may lead to severe illness. They immediately 
start an optimised treatment with ARVs until they are able to return 
to work. Most regrettably, four patients passed away in-service 
from known and diagnosed HIV-related illnesses.

NON-OCCUPATIONAL COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
Managing HIV/Aids and TB 
Implats has a stated TB incidence rate that is below the prevailing 
national incidence rate, and is determined to eliminate Aids-related 
deaths among in-service employees by 2025. As the HIV/Aids 
epidemic continues to mature, more people who have been living 
with HIV are, in the absence of antiretroviral medication (ARVs), 
now developing full-blown Aids, which requires ARV treatment to 
survive.

The Group has an integrated approach to managing TB and HIV 
given the fact that in southern Africa the two infections often occur 
together. The majority (65%) of our diagnosed cases of TB have 
co-infection with HIV. 

Our response includes implementing appropriate health policies, 
proactive efforts to enrol HIV-positive employees on ARV and TB

WE SUPPORT THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST TB 

In recognition of its leadership and world-class programmes for the treatment of TB and HIV/Aids, Impala 
Rustenburg was privileged to host the Mining Industry World TB Day commemoration on 23 March 2023. 

Hospice to fund the training of home-based community care 
workers, who are trained to identify the early signs and 
symptoms of TB and other diseases in the mine-host 
communities. 

The occasion was used to showcase what the mining industry is 
doing in the management of TB. Guests included officials from 
Department of Health (National and North West Province), South 
African National Aids Council, Organised Labour Movements, 
Mineral Council of South Africa, and the International Labour 
Organisation.

The guests visited the new Freedom Park clinic (In Phokeng- 
Bojanala District) that was built by Impala Rustenburg for the 
Department of Health. Guests also witnessed the technology 
and protocols used in Impala Hospital to screen, assess, 
diagnose, and treat employees with TB. To extend its community 
upliftment impact and reduce TB throughout the Bojanala 
district, Impala Rustenburg has partnered with Tapologo 

Diesel particulate matter (DPM) and the potential negative effects 
on employee health are monitored and mitigated through adequate 
ventilation, low sulphur diesel replacement and DPM exhaust filters 
in underground diesel combustion engines. All underground 
locomotives are electric and therefore do not emit DPM. 

NON-OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH 
Non-occupational medical care 
Non-occupational medical care is available to all permanent 
employees and contractors who have primary healthcare 
agreements in place with Group medical facilities.

We have developed a Group-wide technical guideline to monitor 
and control DPM emissions across the different operations to 
ensure we improve our mitigation initiatives. 

MALARIA

Malaria remains classified as a notifiable disease. We 
maintain all awareness and control programmes to 
encourage employees to take prophylaxis. A system is also 
in place to report the diagnosis of malaria cases. This year 
our southern Africa operations conducted malaria 
surveillance programmes.

Two cases (2022: one) of malaria were diagnosed and 
successfully treated at our Zimplats operation. There were 
no new cases of malaria in South Africa.

These include:
•  Elimination – replacing diesel powered engines with alternate 

power sources such as electric and battery power sources
•  Procure/refurbish machines with the latest specification low 

emission diesel engines

•  Consider alternative fuels or cleaner sources of energy 

•  Install exhaust treatment systems such as diesel particulate 

(biodiesel, etc.)

filters and catalysts

•  Implement an effective emission-based maintenance regime
•  Design, implement and maintain an appropriate ventilation 

system. A Group tracking mechanism is being developed to track 
the extent of incidents and the effectiveness of the risk elimination 
strategy

The risk of contracting pneumoconiosis (silicosis) at our operations 
remains exceptionally low because of the very low levels of alpha 
quartz found in the rock we mine. The average dust concentration 
trends recorded remain below the occupational exposure limit. 
Real-time dust monitors are installed at high-risk locations 
underground to detect potential excessive dust volumes, and all 
employees are checked for signs of silicosis at annual occupational 
health screening examinations. 

In 2023, there were no new cases of employees diagnosed with 
silicosis (2022: 11). We provide Isoniazid prophylaxis therapy to 
current known silicosis patients to reduce the risk of developing TB.

74

Cholera
South Africa and Zimbabwe reported several cholera outbreaks in 
2023 with over 350 confirmed cholera deaths since the start of the 
current outbreak. There were no reported cases from employees 
across the Group. Our occupational health centres remain on high 
alert and are assisting government in fighting the outbreak.

Digital occupational health system 
Our digital occupational health system has been implemented at 
Impala Rustenburg and Marula. We value the benefits of using such 
a system to manage our digital data and electronic records, 
especially for our pre-employment and annual examination process. 

The pre-booking and administration process improves patient 
flows, reduces waiting times, and enables electronic recordkeeping 
to assist with reporting and monitoring of health risks and trends. 
The system enables electronic and automated uploads of results 
of the various elements from examinations, including pulse rate, 
blood pressure, height, weight and body mass index, thereby 
increasing efficiency and reducing data capture errors. This 
provides real-time sharing of records between the Occupational 
Health Centre and the other primary care sites and clinics, 
bringing an added advantage for employees and for their 
healthcare professionals.

Medical aid 
At our South African operations, employees and their families have 
access to affordable private healthcare through Group clinics and 
facilities and a range of medical aid options.

The Impala Medical Plan (IMP) is a registered medical scheme that 
provides private care to employees and their dependants through 
Group-owned and operated facilities at Impala Rustenburg, 
Marula and Impala Refineries for those employees who want to 
use these facilities. The contribution rates remain competitive 
against industry norms.

The IMP currently has over 28 900 members (2022: 26 500) 
consisting of their employees and their dependants. In 2024, 
the focus will be to retain cost efficiency while delivering service 
excellence to all members.

At our Zimbabwean operations, because of the challenges in 
the country, Zimplats set up an internal medical scheme in 2020 
to cover employees and their nominated dependants, with the 
specific aim of improving medical cover, medical risk and 
governance, and to generally ensure employees have access to 
quality healthcare.

IMPALA’S HEALTHCARE WORKERS HONOURED

The Joburg Indaba’s SA Mining Hall of Fame recognised and honoured Impala’s healthcare workers and 
their senior team for outstanding performance and exceptional leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The team members were awarded certificates. 

Impala Medical Services (IMS) offered Covid-19 vaccinations to employees, contractors and the community as part of the national 
vaccine rollout in South Africa. The IMS vaccination project was the first to start within the mining industry and administered almost 
32 000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the community in the greater Rustenburg municipal area, almost 60 000 doses to employees 
and more than 25 000 doses to contractors on-site. Impala also assisted other companies to vaccinate their employees and 
contractors. The Impala vaccination programme was recognised by the Minerals Council of South Africa as the best performing 
vaccination and Covid-19 response by a large mine in the country. The SA Mining Hall of Fame was established in 2016 to 
acknowledge and honour individuals who have meaningfully influenced the South African mining industry.

EMPLOYEE WELLBEING
Mental health support 
All employees have access to professional support through 
an employee assistance programme (EAP) and various other 
resources aimed at encouraging wellbeing. Our EAP offers 
counselling in person and online to both employees and 
dependants. 

We support mental health through regular audio-visual awareness 
messages broadcast throughout the organisation, advising of 
full-time counselling services, peer support structures and other 
programmes available to employees. The operation continues to 
implement its leading mental health support programme, which 
has a special emphasis on managing drug and alcohol-related 
issues. 

Financial wellbeing
Implats has financial wellbeing initiatives in place to address the 
causes and mitigate over indebtedness. As part of assisting 
employees, all payroll collection orders are scrutinised and must 
adhere to the legal requirements before implementation.
 
Across our South Africa operations, the benefits of our initiatives 
are evident in decreasing numbers of garnishee, maintenance and 
administration deduction (from salary) orders instituted against our 
employees. We continue to proactively identify employees in need 
of debt counselling and to encourage more employees to use our 
financial wellbeing services. Debt counselling is provided through 
the EAP and heavily indebted employees are referred for additional 
counselling.

MINING

We aim to create self-sustaining and inclusive mine communities through 
positive social and economic contributions to our mine communities. Our social 
performance journey incorporates the wellbeing and long-term sustainability of 
our mine communities which are essential ingredients for maintaining our social 
license to operate and creating future-proof, resilient communities.

OUR APPROACH
Our social performance activities intersect across a wide range 
of organisational, social and operating functions, and are an 
enabler of business outcomes and success. The purpose of 
social performance, along with stakeholder engagement activities, 
is to maintain alignment between the company’s activities and the 
expectations of the local communities, key stakeholders as well as 
the broader society. Central to our social performance and core 
business activities, is the securing and maintaining of Implats’ 
social license to operate.

During the past year, we developed guidelines to support social 
performance across the lifecycle of mining operations and improve 
our social performance maturity level, as measured against ICMM 
guidelines. It is our intention, that, at each mining lifecycle stage, 
Implats continues to go beyond compliance with national 
legislation or regulatory requirements to support more harmonious 
Company-community relationships and enable positive socio-
economic outcomes. Each operating entity has developed mine 
community plans to support this ambition. 

OUR FRAMEWORK

Sustaining livelihoods and building self-
sustaining and inclusive mine communities 
requires going beyond regulatory compliance.

Implats has developed a mine community social performance 
framework that seeks to create measurable and positive 
impacts for both the community and the company across all 
our operations. This framework includes four key focus areas 
namely: community wellbeing, education and skills development, 
enterprise development and inclusive procurement, and resilient 
infrastructure development, with job creation remaining a 
central cross-cutting theme.

OUR PRIORITIES FOR 2024 AND BEYOND
Gender-based violence, substance abuse, youth unemployment, inequality, household food/nutrition insecurity and the digital divide remain 
major concerns, especially within our southern African operating geographies.

In South Africa specifically, we will continue to deliver on our social and labour plan commitments.

Mine community wellbeing

For Implats, mine community wellbeing revolves around ensuring food, nutritional and income security 
as well as access to health and wellbeing services in our mine communities. We specifically target 
vulnerable people in our local communities, including women, children and people living with 
disabilities.

Our main goal is to enhance the health and wellbeing of our mining 
communities by implementing initiatives that prioritise income 
generation, food security and overall health. Additionally, in southern 
Africa, we recognise the pressing issue of GBV, which has tragically 
affected the lives and dignity of many community members. 

Our operations play a vital role in providing employment 
opportunities and social support to address these challenges. 
To ensure our interventions are effective and tailored to the specific 
needs of each community, we conduct thorough needs analyses 
in collaboration with community representatives, as well as 
various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. 
This collaborative approach helps us gain a comprehensive 
understanding of the communities we serve and ensures that 
our interventions are relevant and impactful.

This year, our South African operations invested 
R3 million (2022: R7 million), on several 
community wellbeing projects, a few of which 
are profiled here.

Impala Rustenburg
Supporting food-insecure households
While South Africa appears to be quite self-sufficient in terms of 
food, research estimates that more than 14 million South African 
people do not have access to nutritious, healthy and adequate 
food, and with children being more affected. The same holds true 
for many of our mine communities. 

During the past reporting period, 750 households reaching more 
than 4 200 beneficiaries have been supported through this initiative. 
In the longer term, this programme aims to make vulnerable 
households self-sufficient through various other support initiatives.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Total Group spend on community wellbeing initiatives in 

our mining communities amounted to R46 million 
(2022: R16 million)

•  The Group delivered food security programmes, 

community safety initiatives, water and health infrastructure 
and sponsored places of care for vulnerable members of 
our communities 

•  Our community wellbeing initiatives continue to create and 

support jobs in our operating communities

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Inequality and poverty in many of our mine communities
•  Increase in GBV and substance abuse is concerning
•  Softening PGM basket prices and impact on social spend

SOUTH AFRICA

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND

•  GBV and substance abuse support programmes
•  Agriculture programmes to stimulate non-mining economic 

activity and employment job creation and assist with food 
production

•  Food support programmes
•  Continue to support healthcare services

OUR APPROACH

In the regions where we operate, we encounter 
a range of social challenges. However, there 
are certain common issues that are prevalent 
across these areas, such as poverty, inequality, 
youth unemployment and food insecurity. 

These challenges have a direct impact on the health and overall 
wellbeing of the communities. To address these concerns, our 
community wellbeing initiatives are designed to prioritise and take 
appropriate action based on the specific needs of each operating 
geography.

SESIGO FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMME

Impala Rustenburg has partnered with the Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN) to support mine communities by 
sponsoring a food parcel distribution initiative through the Sesigo Food Security Distribution Agency (SFSDA).

Access to food is a serious challenge for many vulnerable 
households, particularly in rural areas, and very often results in 
malnutrition. 

In 2023, Impala and the RBN supported 4 200 beneficiaries in 
750 households with food parcels consisting of perishable and 
non-perishable items over an eight-month period through this 
initiative. In the longer term, this programme aims to make 
vulnerable households self-sufficient through various other 
support initiatives. 

All identified beneficiaries are profiled to better understand the 
underlying causes of household food insecurity and determine 
their capabilities, interests, and development needs. Once 
profiled, beneficiaries can be linked to support requirements, 
training, and skills development programmes, as well as other 
work programmes that will assist in improving their livelihoods and 
living conditions. 

Distributing food to communities.

GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE INITIATIVES
Community members, especially women and children are often 
victims of GBV, which includes domestic violence, sexual assault 
and harassment. 

Impala Rustenburg has implemented several projects to support 
GBV victims and raise awareness. The operation has provided 
support to the Phokeng Police Station during the 16 Days of 
Activism against GBV, including upgrading facilities for GBV victims. 

Impala Rustenburg has also launched GBV awareness and 
self-defence initiatives in collaboration with local schools, 
reaching over 2 000 learners. To effectively communicate with 
our communities, the operation has translated GBV awareness 
campaigns into local languages. These collective efforts aim to 
combat GBV and foster safer environments for all individuals in 
the areas where we operate.

STRENGTHENING HEALTHCARE SERVICE THROUGH INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

Providing significant health and wellness benefits to the community of Freedom Park.

Freedom Park Clinic represents Impala’s latest investment in 
the Freedom Park mine host community. The clinic was 
constructed at a cost of R14.7 million, and will bring significant 
health and wellness benefits to the community of Freedom 
Park. The clinic facilities can accommodate approximately 300 
patients and will provide the community with access to primary 
healthcare and other services with state-of-the-art equipment, 
including TB UV lights. This comprehensive facility includes 
consultation rooms, an emergency room, a maternity room, 
offices, kitchens, changing rooms, a pharmacy, a utilities area, 
and an external mother and child welfare area. 

During the construction of the clinic, 165 employment 
opportunities were created and 43 community enterprises 
benefited from project-related activity.

Marula
Marula mainly supports community wellbeing by providing enabling 
infrastructure programmes. In 2023, Marula continued to assist 
communities to access water, a critical resource, by providing 
borehole water, submersible pump installations, upgrading 
electrical panels associated with water reticulation systems and 
where required, installing solar power to mitigate effects of power 
disruptions from the state utility on water supply.

Marula’s water projects at Ga Kgwete, Kalani 
Senwamori and Ga Manyaka enabled 1 400 
households to access clean running water and 
supported the creation of more than 
40 employment opportunities. The projects also 
utilised three local mine community 
contractors to complete the work.

Over the years, Marula has constructed various roads and bridges 
in its mine communities to improve safety, reduce dust pollution 
and enable improved economic activity. 

During the past reporting period, the Diphale road was completed 
which supported the creation of 14 employment opportunities and 
utilised one local mine community contractor in the execution of 
the work. 

Impala Refineries

The operation supports various community 
wellbeing projects through monetary donations 
and voluntary in-kind contributions aimed at 
assisting vulnerable community members.

Supporting food-insecure community members
Impala Refineries sponsored the construction of a functional 
and hygienic preparation and eating space for pupils at Bakerton 
Primary School near the operation. Through this initiative, at 
least 370 learners will enjoy nutritious food in a safe and hygienic 
space daily. 

Community Road safety campaign at Marula.

GBV and vulnerable peoples support programmes
The operation continues to support GBV and substance abuse 
initiatives. During the past year, it sponsored a GBV and drug 
awareness campaign, as well as the office for the Springs South 
African Police Service (SAPS) supporting its Family Violence, Child 
Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit. 

Impala Refineries also supports the Enriched Life Organisation, a 
halfway house that integrates individuals addicted to drugs and 
alcohol with their families and society, as well as introduces them 
to skills development opportunities. 

Another noteworthy initiative, is Impala Refineries’ continued 
sponsorship of Vita Nova, a residential facility in Springs for people 
who suffer from cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, autism and other 
physical and mental challenges. About 90% of the residents at the 
facility are abandoned and come from disadvantaged areas.

Zimbabwe

This year, Zimplats spent R40 million 
on community wellbeing projects 
(2022: R7 million).

Zimplats continued to implement community wellbeing projects, 
ensuring longer-term sustainability and impact for mine 
communities. 

Supporting agricultural productivity, income generation and food 
security
Zimplats supported horticulture, cattle and diary projects are 
yielding positive results for communities and farmers involved in the 
projects.

Zimplats, in collaboration with the Rutara, Tyronne, Todyei and 
Gweshe communities, has implemented a horticulture project 
aimed at supporting female-headed and child-headed households 
in the Mhondoro Ngezi and Chegutu rural districts. 

Three smallholder irrigation schemes have been established, with 
a focus on growing garlic as an export crop. In the first phase of 
the project, 23 Rutara families successfully harvested six tonnes 
of organic garlic, generating $13 500 in income. The project has 
now progressed to phase 2, directly supporting 100 families and 
60 seasonal employment opportunities, where the farmers are 
cultivating organic turmeric and ginger for the export market. 
The longer-term impact of these projects ensures foreign currency 
generation and improved income and financial stability.

A Cattle ranching project continues to deliver good results with an 
animal herd of 2 580 cattle and milk production of 1.1 million litres 
per annum. Beef production is at 40 tonnes per annum. The 
project is supporting 250 employment opportunities that were 
previously created and another 100 new employment opportunities 
have been produced. The project has also now expanded to 
support other farmers in growing maize for stock feed for the 
Palmline cattle ranching project supporting 124 families and their 
improved incomes and financial stability.

Support programmes for vulnerable people
Zimplats has continued to support its Albinism campaign, adding 
300 new beneficiaries to 2 000 current participants. The initiative 
includes support for a women-led enterprise that produces 
sunscreen locally. The initiative remains important to reduce skin 
cancer among the participants. 

Substance abuse and associated GBV incidences have increased 
and key initiatives have been put in place to address these 
challenges, especially for our women in the workforce.

Mitigating adverse weather risks
Zimplats launched a community safety awareness campaign on 
risks caused by adverse weather such as extreme heat, fire risks, 
flash floods and other extreme weather events. The campaign is 
reaching between 2.8 to 3 million people via radio and about 
43 000 readers in the sponsored weekly publication.

ZIMPLATS SUPPORTS HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE

Strengthening healthcare service through infrastructure development.

Zimplats also extended its solar power and water interventions 
to health centres in rural communities. The solar systems power 
the institutions’ boreholes, ensure around-the-clock service due 
to improved lighting, and refrigeration of essential medicines and 
vaccines. 

Zimplats continues to support healthcare infrastructure. A key 
highlight of the past year is the completion and handover of the 
Mhondoro Rural Hospital which included the equipping of a new 
theatre, staff houses, laundry facility, kitchen, mortuary, and 
modern outpatients’ ablution facilities. The facility will cater for a 
population of 9 000 and will support child mortality decline which 
currently stands at 55 deaths per 1 000 live births. To date 
$1.1m was invested in the facility and contractors from the 
Zimplats local economic development programme were tasked 
with the construction of the facility. 

Another project supported by Zimplats is the Gweshe Clinic 
upgrade. The project included the construction of a maternity 
ward, the supply of maternity and delivery beds, staff quarters 
and a waiting mothers’ home which will reduce the distance that 
pregnant mothers walk when they are about to deliver their 
babies. It will also reduce home deliveries from five births per 
month to zero, decreasing mortality risks.

Canada

This year, Impala Canada spent R3 million 
on community wellbeing projects (2022: 
R2 million).

Impala Canada’s community investment programmes are focused 
on the local Thunder Bay community, situated 90km from the mine. 
With roughly half of its employees coming from this area, the 
operation is committed to ensuring community wellbeing, and the 
long-term sustainability of the city. 

As part of community wellbeing projects and in support of food 
programmes, the operation continued to support Roots 
Community Food Centre, which supports Thunder Bay residents, 
many from local indigenous communities. 

During the past year the community centre’s dining room was 
opened to support elders and seniors with, socialisation, traditional 
food and healthy meals. The dining room aims to provide an 
opportunity for elders and community members to socialise and 
eat with dignity twice a week, and also allows space for other 
community-based events. 

Impala Canada also sponsored the purchase of fresh local berries 
for four indigenous community market days hosted by Roots 
Community Food Centre allowing more than 400 families to enjoy 
free and fresh berries this summer.

Ongoing events help drive Impala Canada’s support of local 
communities and improve food insecurity awareness. Some of the 
other initiatives included the “36 hours of Christmas Cheer” which 
supported 852 families via hampers that included turkeys. 

Another event was “Wake the Giant Music Festival” which brings 
hundreds of students to Thunder Bay for a few days to get to 
know the city before they enter school. Impala Canada had the 
opportunity to provide breakfast and lunch to more than 180 
students and show its commitment to “Care” in support of 
the company’s values. 

Impala Canada showed its commitment to community safety by 
supporting the purchase of auto vehicle extraction equipment for 
the Municipality of Shuniah’s fire department. This equipment will 
enable quicker response times for emergencies along highway 
527 that services our Lac Des Iles mine and help strengthen 
community relationships.

Mine community education and skills development

Our goal is to deliver education and skills development programmes that open employment 
opportunities.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Total Group spend on education and skills development in 
our mining communities of R121 million (2022: R44 million)

•  In support of our key education and skills development 

targets we supported:
 – Four early childhood development (ECD) centres
 – 55 mine community schools
 – 160 community bursaries/scholarships
 – 500 community learnerships
 – 300+ employment opportunities sustained

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Youth unemployment in our mine communities and 

resultant despair amongst youth

•  Softening PGM basket prices and impact on social spend

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND

•  Closing the “digital divide”
•  Increased support for ECD and foundational schooling 

phases

•  Tracking impact over time 

OUR APPROACH

We believe, in the words of Nelson Mandela, 
“Education is the most powerful weapon which 
you can use to change the world.” 

Investing in education and skills development for community 
members is a strategic priority for Implats as it generates shared 
value. We aim to nurture local talent, offer opportunities for career 
growth, and reduce dependence on external labour sources. 
Education and skills development empower community members 
to access improved employment prospects, resulting in increased 
income, enhanced economic stability, and the development of 
civic rights.

Our objective is to provide comprehensive 
education and skills development programmes 
that create employment opportunities. These 
programmes span from early childhood 
development to higher levels of schooling, 
including adult education and continuous skills 
enhancement. 

Our strategy focuses on improving the quality of education, 
particularly in numeracy and literacy, relevant technical subject 
support and equipping community members with portable 
skills that enable them to participate in the economy and 
support themselves and their families. We prioritise the 
improvement of educational infrastructure, aiming to enhance 
learning environments by upgrading existing school facilities, 
constructing new educational infrastructure and providing water 
infrastructure where needed.

DEVELOPMENTS AT OUR OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF 
OUR GOALS

Impala Rustenburg has embarked on ECD 
centre educator support focussing on 20 
educators to ensure a better-quality education 
for pre-school learners. The operation also 
handed over a flagship ECD centre in Platinum 
Village which has fully furnished classrooms 
and can accommodate 50 learners.

Impala Rustenburg’s extensive school support programme 
continued to assist schools in the Rustenburg area (19 primary 
and 12 high schools) with more than 10 000 learners supported, 
to improve scholastic performance. Almost 200 young teachers 
were mentored to improve their teaching skills. 

Impala Rustenburg also provides Grade 12 learners with Saturday 
classes to prepare them for the secondary school leavers exams. 
The operation also provided learners with quality educational tools, 

including the scientific calculators and rechargeable lanterns to 
assist with studying during power disruptions from the state utility.

In our journey to support young talent, 100 new mining cadets from 
the local communities were enrolled and 327 new learnerships 
started covering the skills such as electrician, fitter, diesel mechanic, 
boilermaker, instrument mechanician and rigger. More than 80% of 
the learners are from the local mine communities.

Our infrastructure developments and upgrades continue to 
support our aim for education and skills development programmes 
that open employment opportunities. In 2023, Impala Rustenburg 
officially handed over a fully refurbished Kutlwanong School for 
the Deaf to education authorities. The school has 269 learners 
enrolled from ECD to primary school.

IMPALA SUPPORTED SCHOOLS YIELD IMPRESSIVE RESULTS

Our school support programmes prepare students to pursue careers in scarce skills categories  
such as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)

Community schools in Rustenburg that participate in our 
school support programmes continue to produce 
impressive results in matric secondary school leavers’ 
exams. This year, the schools achieved an average pass 
rate of 84% (2022: 85%) which is 5% higher than the 
national and provincial average of 79%. The secondary 
schools at Sunrise View and Platinum Village, both 
constructed by Implats and its social partners, achieved 
a 100% (2022: 96%) and a  95% (2022: 97%) pass rate 
respectively.

FACILITATING COMMUNITY ACCESS TO WATER

IMPALA RUSTENBURG AWARDS BURSARIES TO MINE COMMUNITY YOUTH

Impala Rustenburg also ensures that all mine community schools have running water. 

Supporting community education and career goals.

Impala supplied water tanks 
to local schools. To date, 
16 water tanks were erected 
and five boreholes drilled to 
supply more than 5 700 
learners with fresh potable 
water at community schools.

Fifty-five matriculants from Impala Rustenburg mine communities received bursaries to pursue careers in mechanical engineering, 
mining engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, electrical engineering, accounting, surveying, teaching, nursing and human 
resources. Half of the recipients are female learners.

Marula
Marula’s education and skills development programme also 
touches on all parts of the education value chain. Its current 
support focuses on school enrichment programmes, improving 
the learning environment through infrastructure upgrades, and 
post-school education and skills development for community 
members linked to opportunities within mining. Key highlights of 
the past year include:

Marula’s school enrichment programme continued to assist six 
secondary schools, where 262 learners were supported to 
improve mathematics and science skills. The programme also 
provides transport, food, stationary and learning materials. 

Dividends from Marula’s community chrome enterprise 
(Makgomo Chrome) continue to support education initiatives. 
Among other initiatives these proceeds are used to deliver 
programmes in mathematics for students and teachers in the 
mine community, supply school uniform to local learners and 
administrative equipment to local schools. 

During the past year, 77 local community 
members were enrolled in Marula’s mining 
novices skills development programme and 
24 graduates started their internships at the 
mine. The mine awarded 26 bursaries to 
community members.

Various school infrastructure projects are currently in progress, 
but, during the past year, the operation constructed and handed 
over four classroom blocks at Ntoshang Primary, Manyaka Primary, 
Mosedi Secondary and Dihlabakela Secondary. Two mobile 
classrooms at Dihlabakela Secondary were also completed and 
handed over. In total, these initiatives supported a better learning 
environment for more than 500 learners.

CONSTRUCTION AND HANDOVER OF MADIKANE ECD CENTRE

An ECD centre was constructed to assist children in the Marula community access a proper learning facility. 
In total, 44 pupils benefit from the facility.

The centre officially started functioning during February 2023 
although full construction was completed in June 2023. 
Currently 44 pupils benefit from the facility and the mine 
evaluates additional needs and provides ongoing support to the 
centre.

The creche infrastructure includes classrooms, resting rooms, 
kitchen, toilets fully equipped and furnished. 

Impala Refineries
Impala Refineries supports a number of local schools and 
educational initiatives.

Impala Refineries continued to support the Kwa-Thema Early 
Childhood Development Centre (ECD) which focuses on all 
preschool age groups starting from babies to Grade R. One of the 
specialities of the centre is their work with children with severe 
disabilities. The centre offers improved learning environments for 
70 children with severe physical and mental disabilities. 

On 2 June 2023, Impala Refineries donated a vehicle to the 
Kwa-Thema Stimulation Centre in partnership with The Federated 
Employers Mutual Assurance Company to transport children living 
with disabilities. 

Impala Refineries’ school achiever programme continued to assist 
learners to improve scholastic performance. 

Impala Refineries’ supported learners achieved 100% matric pass 
rates, which is much higher than the national overall pass rate of 
79%. This is the fourth consecutive year that the programme has 
achieved this outcome.

Zimplats spent approximately R24 million to support education and 
skills development (2022: R8 million).

Zimplats funded the construction of two 
classroom blocks each with four classrooms 
and ablution facilities, at the local Turf Primary 
School. The upgrade reduced the teacher-
student ratio to an average of 1:40 from 1:55 
and led to improved learning outcomes and 
pass rates.

Zimplats strengthened its partnership with Gwebi College of 
Agriculture, where the operation invested in the dairy parlour and 
supported about 25 community members with training covering 
skills such as crop production, harvesting, post-harvest 
management and value addition, marketing and value chain, 
and budgeting.

An additional 225 community members were trained in 
partnerships with the Department of Agriculture Extension Services 
and the Traditional Grain Producers Association. 

Canada

Impala Canada spent R5 million to support 
education and skills development (2022: 
R3 million).

Impala Canada offers ongoing support to various educational 
initiatives in Thunder Bay, including multi-year donation 
commitments to the local university and college as well as several 
educational scholarships, primarily in support of indigenous 
students.

Impala Canada donated activity bags for indigenous children to 
complement existing events and activities in local indigenous 
communities throughout the summer. The operation purchased, 
prepared and delivered 1 200 backpacks filled with art supplies 
and activities for children. 

Impala Canada provided financial support to five students from 
Confederation College, a local college with many skilled trades 
programmes. This is to ensure a healthy pipeline of skill trades in 
Northwestern Ontario.

The “Paving the Way Scholarship Programme” 
is a new initiative at Impala Canada which 
provides tuition support for post-secondary 
education to dependants of employees. So far 
28 scholarships have been awarded.

The operation also continued to partner with Outland Youth 
Employment Programme (OYEP) to support approximately 
20 indigenous teens with real-world work scenario education.

indigenous teens. The goal is to boost the youth confidence. It also 
continues to support Indspire, an indigenous national charity that 
supports education for youth from the First Nations, Inuit and Métis 
indigenous communities and supports 12 bursaries (2022: 10).

Inclusive procurement and mine community enterprise and supplier development 
(ESD) 

GRI 204-1

Our procurement and business development programmes enable host community enterprises to 
become part of our supply chain and transition to providing their services nationally.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  R17.3 billion discretionary procurement spend for South 

African operations, with R12.0 billion spent at Impala 
Rustenburg, R3.2 billion at Impala Refineries and R2.1 billion 
at Marula (2022: R14.7 billion)

•  Spend with local-to-site (tier 1) suppliers in South Africa was 

unchanged at R2.0 billion (2022: R2.0 billion)

•  Supported more than 940 community-based enterprises, 

sustaining 5100 employment opportunities

•  Impala Rustenburg officially launched its Economic Inclusion 

Centre (EIC) to assist local entrepreneurs access procurement 
opportunities at the mine and beyond 

•  R1.2 billion (US$66 million, 9% of total discretionary 

procurement spend) with local enterprise development 
suppliers who are predominantly from our mine host 
communities in Zimbabwe (2022: R837 million or 
US$55 million)

•  Zimplats expansion projects creating procurement and 

employment opportunities for local enterprises

•  R637 million (C$48 million) spent with indigenous communities 
in Canada (2022: R481 million or C$40 million). This represents 
15% of total discretionary spend (2022: 13%)

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Socio-economic challenges in mine communities continue 

to raise expectations for procurement opportunities 

•  A significant number of women and youth-owned 
businesses from our communities fall short of the 
requirements to participate in sourcing events. These 
businesses will be assisted through our enterprise and 
supplier development (ESD) programmes

•  Year-on-year increase in spend on imports at Zimplats 

largely due to procurement activities associated with capital 
projects 

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND

•  Develop women and youth-owned businesses through 

ESD programmes 

•  Continue to advance initiatives to improve local and 

indigenous procurement opportunities at Impala Canada
•  Empower local suppliers in Zimbabwe to develop import 

substitutions 

OUR APPROACH

The goal is to accelerate inclusive economic 
growth by developing host community 
businesses, particularly women and youth-
owned enterprises, to participate in our supply 
chain and beyond.

Our key commitments are to:

SDG 10.2
Prioritise procurement from 
the host community and 
indigenous enterprises

SDG 8.3
Support the development of 
resilient SMMEs in our value 
chain and beyond

Implats is committed to creating a better future by developing 
economically self-sustaining and resilient mine communities. We 
have an established Group procurement policy statement that 
helps us guide our inclusive procurement initiatives.

Our long-term strategic focus is to help community enterprises 
become part of our supply chain and transition to providing their 
services nationally. This is achieved through our ESD initiatives in 
South Africa and local economic development (LED) initiatives in 
Zimbabwe. To encourage procurement prospects with indigenous-
owned and operated businesses in Canada, we maintain a 
thorough understanding of the capabilities that exist within 
indigenous communities and have a pipeline of bidders and 
potential opportunities for joint ventures. We also work with the 
Chamber of Commerce in Thunder Bay to strengthen the mining 
value chain in the region.

Our tender process provides opportunities for 
businesses to participate in our supply chain 
through the award of formal fixed-term 
contracts. Preference is given to community 
suppliers through the adjudication-weighted 
scoring methodology. In 2023, the Group 
launched an all-new digital platform for its 
South Africa operations. Tender opportunities 
can now be accessed via the Implats website, 
enhancing organisational transparency and 
increasing participation from potential bidders.

Impala Mine Host Community Business Forum Engagement Platform 
(MHCBF). This platform was designed to address the growing 
demand for procurement opportunities from mine communities’ 
business forums. This engagement platform will provide local business 
forums with information on inclusive preferential procurement 
opportunities and ESD initiatives, and will assist Impala update the 
business forums on progress with procurement spend and provide 
a structure for constructive feedback. 

Progress with regards to inclusive 
procurement, ESD and LED are reported on 
quarterly to operational board committees 
and annually to the STR committee and, 
given the socio-economic challenges in our 
communities, features prominently in our 
regular engagements with communities and 
community-based business forums. 

In South Africa, our commitments and progress with respect to 
spend with HDP-owned (HDPO) businesses are reported to 
community stakeholders and the DMRE, with a particular focus on 
procurement spend with majority black women-owned and 
youth-owned suppliers.

Impala performance against SLP targets

South Africa
In 2023, we procured goods and services worth R2.0 billion 
from suppliers in the communities closest to our operations 
(2022: R2.0 billion), with R1.8 billion spent at Impala Rustenburg 
(2022: R1.8 billion) and R159 million at Marula (R188 million). 
These community businesses are defined as tier 1*. 

Unfortunately, at our Marula operation, spend on services with 
HDPO and women-owned enterprises was below our stated 
targets at year-end. The B-BBEE certificates of a significant 
number of suppliers in these categories expired in the reporting 
period and our spend with these enterprises was not recognised by 
our system. Work is underway to address this. Although it remains 
a challenge, both Impala Rustenburg and Marula operations have 
advanced initiatives to avail opportunities to tier 1 companies with 
particular emphasis on black women and youth-owned 
businesses. Women and youth-owned businesses that narrowly 
fall short of  
our requirements to participate in a sourcing event will in future be 
referred to our ESD programme for development. This will assist 
operations to continue to make good progress against their 
targeted spend, with these designated groups in line with SLP 
commitments.

Supporting our commitment to inclusive procurement and 
developing successful businesses
Our ESD programmes provide important opportunities for host 
community entrepreneurs to develop and become sustainable 
enterprises that can provide our operations with high-quality goods 
and services and pursue opportunities beyond the mine gate. 

A total of R13 million was spent on ESD initiatives in South Africa 
this year (2022: R14 million).

We equip community businesses with the necessary skills to grow 
in a sustainable manner and create jobs, in turn stimulating 
economic growth in the region and the country. 

Marula’s business development centre (BDC) 
continues to play an important role in its ESD 
initiatives and in helping community SMMEs 
gain access to procurement opportunities at 
the mine and elsewhere. The centre offers free 
internet connectivity for community 
businesses, and assists entrepreneurs to 
register businesses, obtain free business 
coaching, generate invoices and prepare tender 
documents.

IMPALA RUSTENBURG’S SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT HUB 

EMPOWERING HOST COMMUNITY WOMEN-OWNED ENTERPRISES 

Empowering community enterprises to access opportunities at our mines and beyond.

Local women-owned enterprises supporting our growth.

In 2023, Impala Rustenburg officially launched its R10.4 million Economic Inclusion Centre (EIC), a business hub central to all mine 
host communities, and intends to offer opportunities to community businesses. 

From this multi-functional venue, Impala Rustenburg provides community enterprises with services including business training, 
assistance with market access and funding facilitation, as well as shared office space, access to boardrooms and offices, computer 
workstations and printing and scanning facilities.

Since October 2022, the facility had 742 visits from 371 individuals.

Impala Rustenburg has grown significantly over the past few years. To accommodate this growth, Impala invested just over
R40 million to expand facilities at 16 Shaft. A new change house, expanded lamp room facilities, and modernised offices were included 
in the expansion project. The facilities will contribute to improving morale at the shaft, as well as culture, efficiency and productivity. The 
project was successfully completed in partnership with a women-owned mine community SMME, the Mmakgoge Group, highlighting 
the Group’s commitment to empowering women.

Kgomotso Motuku, Director at Mmakgoge Group, said: “We were thrilled to partner with Impala Rustenburg on this project. The 
opportunity allowed us to showcase our skills, capacity and quality of work. It is also positive that Impala is invested in providing 
opportunities that allow for gender diversity and women empowerment, and I commend the company for that.”

Local sub-contractors from the mine communities were also employed on the project, which saw 110 local residents involved.

Zimbabwe

Zimplats spent R13.2 billion or US$742 million 
(2022: US$552 million) procuring goods and 
services in 2023, a 26% increase year-on-year. 

Local procurement spend (in-country spend including that with 
enterprises owned 51% by indigenous Zimbabweans) represented 
47% of total procurement spend (2022: 58%). This was mainly 
attributable to Zimplats’ growth and expansion capital projects that 
had a significant import portion. Approximately 53% of spend was 
on imports. 

Zimplats prioritises procurement from local indigenous suppliers, 
especially those that are part of the operation’s local enterprise 
development (LED) programme. These suppliers typically reside 
within a 10km radius of our operations. The programme comprises 
22 small and medium enterprises, of which 32% are women and 
youth enterprises. These companies are all guaranteed a certain 
level of business with Zimplats. In 2023, a number of LEDs were 

able to provide goods and services beyond Zimplats. Furthermore, 
the LEDs positively impact communities through job creation, skills 
development, investment in local infrastructure, and the overall 
establishment of thriving and healthy host communities, 
contributing towards the company’s social licence to operate. 

As at year-end, 22 LED beneficiaries provided 
decent work to 3 402 people, an 11% increase 
in employment creation compared to last 
year’s 3 038, mainly due to Zimplats’ expansion 
projects.

LED beneficiaries have contributed to supply chain efficiencies 
associated with proximity for services, especially labour and other 
materials such as river sand and quarry stones for construction 
purposes, thus reducing costs and delivery times.

CREATING SUSTAINABLE YOUTH-OWNED BUSINESSES

SUPPORTING INDIGENOUS BUSINESSES IN NORTHERN ONTARIO

Combined Technical Services Zimbabwe has grown into a thriving business with clients beyond Zimplats.

Impala Canada aims to develop relationships with indigenous entrepreneurs to drive awareness of our 
operations and broaden our supplier base.

The Ngezi-based LED beneficiary has established a state-of-the-art drive train manufacturing and repair centre in Turf Town, 
Mhondoro Ngezi. 

Impala Canada is a sponsor of the Thunder Bay Community and Economic Development Commission’s Indigenous Entrepreneur 
programme – Miinikaanan Badakidoon. 

The centre is an import substitution facility that has reduced turnaround times through manufacturing, repairing and reconditioning 
of load haulage dumpers (LHD) components and the supply of components for other mining equipment. The youth-owned 
enterprise is now providing one-stop local engineering products and services at competitive prices for its key clients that include 
Zimplats and other mining houses within the country. 

The ultimate goal of the programme is to help indigenous entrepreneurs looking to start up, expand or buy an existing business. Our 
partnership offers indigenous entrepreneurs an opportunity to connect with Impala Canada finance, human resources and 
procurement team members to learn, among other things, about procurement opportunities in mining. 

Where our needs overlap with more robust local industries – such 
as forestry, road construction, safety and healthcare – we are able 
to source our contracts locally. However, mining-specific needs, 
like hoist parts and underground vehicles and services, remain a 
challenge to source locally. 

In 2023, management continued to advance several initiatives 
to progress local and indigenous spend including: 
•  Impala Canada built and launched an all-new, online 

procurement portal. It was initially promoted to existing suppliers, 
then to the procurement community via trade expos, and is now 
being marketed publicly. The goal of the portal is to increase 
transparency and identify more local businesses to join the 
supplier network 

•  There have been 82 new local suppliers registered since the 

portal went live in September 2022, of which 41 of them have 
been used to procure goods and services 

•  Increased partnerships with Mining Expos and participation in 

other local public events in the region to increase brand 
recognition and to identify local purchasing and supply chain 
opportunities 

Canada
The Lac des Iles Mine has a long history of strong ties to its host 
communities and understands that it has the responsibility to help 
them grow and thrive. 

Impala Canada purchased goods and services to the value of 
R4.3 billion or C$323 million (2022: R3.8 billion or C$316 million). 
Impala Canada’s procurement policies and processes reflect its 
responsibility to help local and indigenous communities succeed. 
The operation has developed a procurement process that fairly and 
effectively provides local businesses – and, in particular, 
Indigenous-owned and operated businesses – increased 
opportunity to be awarded contracts for providing goods and 
services. The more successful these companies are at Impala 
Canada, the more experience they will develop, and the more 
competitive they will ultimately become in the wider marketplace.

Impala Canada’s total spend with local vendors 
continues to climb year-on-year. Spend with 
Indigenous owned and/or operated companies 
increased significantly from R481 million 
(C$40 million) in 2022 to R637 million 
(C$48 million) in 2023. Impala Canada 
continues to work to grow its local and local 
Indigenous procurement; part of this work 
includes steps to attract and support capacity 
building for mining industry-specific suppliers 
in the Thunder Bay area.

OUR APPROACH
Environmental legal compliance
We continuously monitor regulatory changes to ensure compliance 
through action plans and rigorously track progress against both 
internal and external audit findings. We report any deviations from 
regulatory conditions to the relevant authorities and engage 
proactively and transparently with the relevant stakeholders to 
address any compliance matters that should arise.

Compliance reports, alongside internal audit reports, are shared 
with the relevant board sub-committees every quarter. We actively 
participate in regional industry associations to support policy 
development and promotion of best practices.  GRI 307-MA

shipping or handling of our products during 2023.

Environmental incidents
We recorded seven limited impact (level 3) incidents, a 75% 
increase on the four incidents recorded in 2022. The majority of the 
incidents related to the uncontrolled release of water effluent at our 
managed operations as a result of excessive and unseasonal 
rainfall. Each incident was investigated, and remedial action taken. 

None of the reported incidents resulted in any 
fines or lasting harm to the environment. 

Our goal is to consistently reduce the number of level 3 incidents 
and to eliminate all water-related environmental incidents by 2030. 

Reducing our environmental footprint (continued)

Impala Refineries also retained its Responsible Care® certification, 
the global chemical industry’s comprehensive safety, health, 
environment and security performance improvement initiative.

Product stewardship
We routinely scrutinise legislative changes relating to product 
stewardship to ensure we are aligned with best practice such as 
the UN’s Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of classification and 
labelling of chemicals and the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, 
Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH).

We develop material data sheets and communicate with those 
handling our products; this information is also available on our 
website. Comprehensive systems are in place to maintain a 
continuous process of product testing, hazard assessment and 
communication. Relevant packaging, labelling and consignment 
procedures are in place and our employees receive relevant 
training on hazards regarding products.

Climate-change and energy management

The increasing evidence globally of physical climate impacts – wildfires, floods, rising temperatures – 
is driving a greater sense of urgency in building adaptive capacity and resilience to climate. We are 
dedicated to decarbonising our operations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. 

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Progressed several decarbonisation initiatives, including the 

signing an offtake agreement for additional 50MW 
hydropower for our Zimplats operation, increasing the 
operations renewable electricity mix to 67% of electricity 
consumed

•  Advanced studies for renewable electricity and low-carbon 

energy fuel sources for Impala Rustenburg, Impala 
Refineries and Marula in line with decarbonisation and 
energy security plan

•  The Group issued its second climate change report aligned 

with the recommendations of the TCFD

•  Improved our scope 3 emission accounting in line with best 

practice to include additional activities related to the 
purchased goods and services and upstream and 
downstream transportation of materials

•  Continued participation in annual CDP – Climate disclosure

•  Energy security in southern Africa remains a Group top 5 

risk, with losses in production due to electricity load 
curtailment

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024

•  Confirm site-specific projects for strengthening energy 

security, diversifying our energy mix and improving efficiency

•  Continue implementing energy security and 

decarbonisation roadmap

OUR APPROACH
We recognise that climate change is a global challenge requiring 
businesses to reduce GHG emissions across the value chain, and 
to build operational resilience while ensuring transparent 
communication and engagement with stakeholders. 

Our decarbonisation and energy security policy statement applies 
to all our managed operations. This policy is endorsed by the 
Implats board and outlines our commitments towards the adoption 
of renewable and low-carbon energy sources as well as the 
transparent communication of the potential impacts of climate 
change on our business. Our non-managed operations have  
similarly aligned policies and practices and are in the process of 
implementing decarbonisation and renewable energy initiatives.

Climate-related issues are addressed quarterly 
in various board committees. The executive: 
sustainable development supports the Exco by 
developing the ESG/sustainability framework 
and strategy and reviewing performance in 
terms of the Group’s non-financial indicators, 
while also being responsible for the 
environmental performance. The Group head: 
energy and Group head: environment facilitate 
the development of our energy management 
and decarbonisation plans respectively.

Our board has approved several key policy statements that 
emphasise our commitment to combat climate change. Among 
others, we commit to:
•  Conducting climate change risk and opportunities assessments
•  Engaging in public policy advocacy to support low-carbon 
energy solutions for industry groups and local communities

•  Identifying, reviewing and updating risks impacting our 

biodiversity, rehabilitation, and post-closure management efforts
•  Including decarbonisation performance measures in executive 

remuneration structures

stakeholders a detailed account of the key 
developments to mitigate climate change risks and 
opportunities, and our approach to a just transition.

Further disclosure on our climate-related practices appears in 
our 2023 submission to the CDP https://www.implats.co.
za/pdf/esg/2023/CDP-Climate-Change-Response.pdf. Implats 
received a B rating – higher than the mineral mining sector 
average of C for our 2022 submission.

DECARBONISATION ROADMAP TO 2030
The Group is committed to reducing carbon emissions by 30% (approximately 1 379 kt CO2e) by 2030 from the 2019 base year. Our focus 
this year has been on implementing projects, specifically electricity supply shifts to renewable electricity, in line with this goal. This also helps 
to improve our electricity security, particularly in southern Africa where loadshedding, ageing infrastructure and rising electricity costs pose a 
strategic risk to our operations. Our electricity supply risk is discussed in detail in our annual integrated report. Our decarbonisation 
pathways as well as responses to physical and transition risks associated with climate change are disclosed in our 2023 climate change 
report. 

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

Group wheeled

procurement 
programme

Impala 
Rustenburg

Zimplats

Implats’ programme to procure 200MW wheeled renewable electricity for all South African operations — wheeling 
is the process of moving privately generated electricity (own-generated or generated by independent power 
producers) to customers across national utility-owned power grids – has progressed to the request for proposal 
phase. Energy wheeling will address the limitations related to land availability at Marula, Impala Rustenburg and 
Impala Refineries.

Impala Rustenburg has completed prefeasibility studies to implement 140MW of renewable energy projects. The 
operation has also commissioned approximately 7kW of rooftop solar systems that have resulted in 238tCO2e 
emissions avoided. 

Impala Rustenburg also realised energy savings of approximately 50 358 00kWh through its energy efficiency 
programme, avoiding 66 000tCO2e and saving the operation R74 million. These savings are verified by a third 
party.

In April 2023 Zimplats entered into a power purchase agreement with the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation 
Limited (ZESCO) for the supply of an additional 50MW of hydropower electricity. This brings the total renewable 
electricity component for the operation to approximately 67%. The additional hydropower electricity led to 
72 005tCO2e avoided at Zimplats. Zimplats is also midway through the construction of a US$37 million solar plant 
at its Selous Metallurgical Complex. The 35MW facility is the first phase of an intended 185MW complex that will 
secure supply and reduce the unit cost of energy. The first phase will go live in the second quarter of 2024.

Marula

Our Marula operation advanced its studies into a 30MW behind-the-meter renewable energy project to the 
feasibility study phase.

•  Our carbon emissions intensity decreased by 6% year-on-year 

in CO2e/tonne milled in line with reduced grid electricity 
consumption and increased production

OUR 2023 PERFORMANCE
•  Total energy consumption energy (derived as the sum of direct 
energy – energy from use of fuels on-site and indirect energy – 
energy from purchased electricity) was 19 640GJ (000) down 
1% from 19 749GJ (000). GRI 302-1

•  Total CO2e emissions for the Group were 4 022kt (scope 1 and 
scope 2), 1% decrease year-on-year (2022: 4 072kt) in line with 
overall reduction in grid electricity consumption (primarily 
generated from coal) and an increase in renewable electricity 
from ZESCO at Zimplats in the fourth quarter of 2023

Introduction Group overviewLeadership reviewsGovernanceOur social performanceOur environmental performanceAppendixWater stewardship

We recognise that access to clean water is a human right, and a requirement for economic 
development and to maintain the integrity of ecosystems.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Achieved a CDP Water Disclosure Project score of 

A- (A- rating in 2022)

•  52% (2022: 53%) of water used was recycled water, 

against an increased target of 54%

•  3% reduction in potable water used from municipalities 

year-on-year

•  Improved compliance with conditions of water use licences 

(WULs). Implats invested an estimated R379 million on 
various projects to improve water management, security and 
water use efficiencies for operations (2022: R324 million)

•  Implats operations in water stress regions celebrated water 
month (March 2023) through various awareness campaigns

•  Impala Rustenburg collaborated with the North West Parks 

Board for Wetlands Month to create awareness in local schools

•  No protected ecosystem (for example, Ramsar-listed 

wetland) or habitat was materially affected by our extraction 
and use of water

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Four limited-impact water-related incidents (level 3) were 
recorded, all related to unseasonal and extreme rainfall at 
our Marula operation 

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024

•  Achieve zero uncontrolled water discharges
•  Align water reporting with the ICMM water reporting guidance
•  Conduct catchment level water risk assessments
•  Achieve a 54% water recycling target

OUR APPROACH
We are committed to responsible water stewardship. Our 
governance, practices and procedures with respect to water 
management are outlined in our Group water policy.

We aim to enhance our resilience to changing and improving our 
understanding of community water needs. We continue to assist 
with public water infrastructure maintenance in South Africa and
Zimbabwe and participation in catchment forums in our areas of 
operation to profile catchment level risks and to positively influence 
water management practices. 

GRI 303-1

Our goal is to achieve 70% water recycling by 2030 and to 
continuously decrease our freshwater intake from municipal 
sources. This means we must progressively increase our water 
reuse and recycling and improve our water-use efficiency. We 
have developed dynamic water balance models and conducted 
catchment level water risk assessments to achieve our aim of zero 
uncontrolled discharges, while conducting projects to improve 
water recycling. We also collaborate with governments to develop 
solutions to ensure our mine-host communities have sustainable 
access to water. 

Our Canada and Zimplats operations have necessary licences and 
permissions to discharge water to surrounding fresh surface water 
bodies. Our operations ensure that water discharged is treated, 
meets or exceeds the stringent quality standards set out by 
authorities and does not exceed permissible volumes. We 
continuously monitor surface and groundwater for any anomalies 
and conduct annual water risk assessments. Our water use 
permits or licences are renewed annually. 

DEVELOPMENTS AT OUR OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF 
OUR TARGETS AND TO ADDRESS WATER RISKS
Impala Rustenburg
Impala Rustenburg accounts for 48% of the Group’s total water 
consumption. The operation used on average 22Ml/day of potable 

water against allocation of 50Ml/day in 2023 (2022: 21Ml/day 
against 50Ml/day allocation).
 
The top three water risks at Impala Rustenburg and the associated 
projects and initiatives advanced per risk area are shown below.

Risk

Initiatives advanced and spend in 2023

Interruption to water supply 
to operations and 
surrounding communities

•  Progressed construction activities for the installation of two water reservoirs 

on-site with capacity to support operations for 24-48 hours. R56 million 
spent in 2023 (2022: R58 million). A total of R125 million is planned over 
the next five years on the project. 

•  R64 million (2022: R50 million) in ongoing spend to improve stormwater 

recovery and storage for reuse 

Groundwater contamination

•  Monitor scavenging boreholes at tailings facilities for contamination
•  Monitor and maintain tailings water piping 

Deterioration of water supply 
infrastructure

•  We continue to engage with stakeholders at catchment level and lend our 

expertise to local municipalities to fix infrastructure

Increased

Decreased

No change

The operation typically receives 10 Ml treated effluent daily from the Rustenburg Water Services Trust (RWST) and is aiming to increase this 
allotment to 12Ml by 2024 to further reduce its freshwater intake. However, it should be noted that electricity disruptions due to load curtailment in 
South Africa has negatively impacted the availability of greywater to our operations. The Impala Rustenburg environmental manager responsible for 
water stewardship is a trustee of the RWST.

Impala Refineries
Impala Refineries in Springs is situated near the Blesbokspruit, a 
designated Ramsar Convention Wetland of international importance. 
Although the operation does not have any direct impact on the 
wetland, it continues to partner in environmental education and 
conservation initiatives in the area and makes in-kind contributions to 
the Grootvaly Blesbokspruit Trust.

Impala Refineries top water-related risk relates to its inability to treat 
effluent water in the event of severe weather events and the 

unavailability of water. The operation’s WUL is currently under review 
for renewal by authorities. 

Treated effluent water will reduce the amount of potable water used by 
the operation. The operation is also working with the National Centre 
for Cleaner Production (NCPC) of the Council of Scientific and 
Industrial Research (CSIR) to investigate additional recycling 
possibilities on-site.

•  R105 million (2022: R107 million) was spent to bolster effluent treatment 

capacity and to advance preparatory work for the installation of a new liner 
with leak detection at the old BMR effluent pond. The majority of plant 
upgrade initiatives are due for completion in 2025, with the installation 
of new liner planned for 2026. 

Interruption to water supply 
to operations

•  The effluent treatment projects above have the potential to improve water 
recycling at Impala Refineries, reducing the operation’s reliance on potable 
water supply from external parties

Regulatory compliance

•  The operation is in the process of implementing various projects to ensure 

compliance with its WUL. This includes the upgrade of effluent treatment 
plants and the re-lining of an effluent pond planned for completion in 2025 
and 2026 respectively.

Marula
In 2023, Marula experienced unseasonal and excessive rainfall which provided a challenge for water management facilities. As a result, we 
recorded four level 3 incidents related to the uncontrolled release of water from our storage dams at the site. These incidents were reported 
to the relevant authorities and did not result in any environmental damage. Marula is bolstering its water storage and management 
capabilities to mitigate the increased risk of effluent release due to severe weather events in the area. Its other water risks relate to 
unavailability of water to operations and communities not consistent with other bold in the report. Marula’s business improvement manager 
holds the chairmanship in the Lebalelo Project’s governance structure. The Lebalelo project is due for completion in 2050. As part of its 
community wellbeing initiatives, Marula also assists communities to access water by drilling boreholes and upgrading water reticulation 
networks (see page 82).

Impala Canada
Although Impala Canada is water positive, it has a comprehensive water monitoring programme in place in accordance with government 
regulations. The programme monitors surface and groundwater quality, sediment quality, fish population studies and more. 

The operation’s top water-related risk relates to regulatory compliance and does not require any material capital spend on water projects. 
Impala Canada continues to upgrade its collection ponds with geosynthetic liners, and monitor its network of 28 groundwater monitoring 
wells surrounding the mine site.

As noted in last year’s report, Impala Canada installed a potable water treatment plant to ensure that the mine has sufficient potable water 
to meet its daily demands.

•  R41 million (2022: R41 million) invested in the Lebalelo project scheme to 
supply water to the mine and surrounding communities and in projects to 
reduce water losses by upgrading underground pipelines and shaft 
compressor cooling towers 

Management has installed temporary additional water storage capacity on-site 
and improved monitoring equipment at existing water storage dams.

OUR 2023 PERFORMANCE
Water recycled/re-used decreased slightly year-on-year due to 
lower water returns from tailings dams and lower volumes of 
greywater received (water re-used) from external organisations 
as a result of electricity disruptions in South Africa.

Our water management strategies and practices are further detailed 
in our annual submission to the CDP Water Disclosure Project (2022

WATER AWARENESS

Impala Rustenburg’s environmental department celebrated Wetlands’ Month in collaboration with the 
North West Parks and Tourism Board.

Selected Grade 10 and 11 learners from mine community high schools spent a day at the Pilanesberg National Park to experience 
first-hand, the restorative and rehabilitation work on the wetlands facilitated by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the 
Environment.

Air quality management

We minimise the potential negative impacts of our operations on air quality by optimising our 
processes and installing best-in-class abatement technologies.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  The sulphur dioxide (SO2) abatement project at Zimplats is 

progressing well. The project entails the installation of 
best-in-class SO2 abatement technology

•  Approximately R1 357 million spent on air quality 

improvement initiatives across the Group, with the majority 
of the spend, an estimated R1 054 million spent at 
Zimplats (2022: R238 million)

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Two air quality level 3 incident related to dust was recorded 

at our operations (2022: Two air quality level 3 incidents)

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024

•  Ensure emissions are minimised and permit conditions met
•  Continue construction of SO2 abatement technology at 

•  Install equipment that will reduce particulate matter levels 

Zimplats

at Impala Refineries

OUR APPROACH
The most significant air quality issue for the Group relates
to the sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from our smelting
operations at Zimplats. Our Impala Rustenburg smelter and 
coal-fired boilers at Impala Refineries both employ effective SO2 
abatement technologies. 

Over and above SO2 emissions, we monitor particulate matter 
(PM) in line with regulatory requirements and best practice. 
Our highest-priority particulate emissions remain those that 
are classified as PM10 and PM2.5 (PM of less than 10 and 
2.5 microns, respectively). This relates to PM from unit operations 
or dust from tailings dams and stockpiles. We also disclose the 
indirect emissions of SO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx) associated 
with the use of grid electricity that is generated from coal (see 
page 145). 

Our operations have extensive ambient air 
quality monitoring networks in place and 
measure SO2 and particulate matter (PM) in line 
with regulatory requirements and best 
practice. 

Impala Rustenburg and Impala Refineries are located in air quality 
priority areas, and as such are mandated to establish air quality 
management plans, to achieve and maintain compliance with 
ambient air quality standards. 

Impala Rustenburg forms part of the 
Multistakeholder reference group for the 
Waterberg Bojanala priority area and 
participates in the Bojanala industry task team 
on air quality and other environmental matters.

We record all air quality incidents and complaints, and develop 
appropriate mitigation and corrective measures.

We continue to implement dust suppression initiatives, including 
the revegetation of barren surfaces, particularly at the tailings 
storage facilities. We also pave roads in host communities at our 
southern Africa operations to reduce the levels of dust in the air 
(see page 82).

SO2 emitted at Zimplats constitutes approximately 79% of total SO2 emissions for the Group. 

The construction of a sulphuric acid plant at Zimplats will give 
the operation’s smelting facilities an industry-leading 
environmental footprint and provide the business with a saleable 
commodity that will support and grow economic activity in the 
region. Commissioning of the acid plant is expected in 2026.

Impala 
Canada

The Rustenburg operation received a renewed atmospheric emission licence (AEL) from the licensing authority in 
February 2023 to incorporate an additional flash dryer at the smelter.
Our smelter employs industry-leading SO2 abatement technologies, such as the SulfAcid™ catalytic conversion 
and Dynawave© wet lime forced oxidation processes.
The operation has projects in place to optimise its SO2 abatement plant, reduce PM emissions from its dryer plants 
and improve its air quality monitoring systems.

Impala Refineries has an AEL dated 1 September 2020. This year, the operation spent over R80 million on 
initiatives to reduce PM from its ammonium sulfate and cobalt plant as part of an air quality improvement 
programme to be completed by June 2024.

There was no significant capital spend on air quality management at Marula and the operation does not require 
material capital spend to maintain its AEL. 

Implementation of the R4 billion smelter upgrade project, which includes the installation of a SO2 abatement plant 
at Zimplats, commenced in 2022 and is progressing well. Commissioning of the project is planned for June 2026.

Impala Canada has management policies and practices prepared in accordance with Approaches to Manage 
Industrial Fugitive Dust Sources of the Procedure for Preparing an Emission Summary and Dispersion Modelling 
Report (Ontario Ministry of the Environment 2009), and The Guide to the Preparation of a Best Management 
Practices Plan for the Control of Fugitive Dust for the Ontario Mining Sector (Centre for Excellence in Mining 
Innovation, August 2010) and meets the requirements prescribed by the facility’s environmental compliance 
approval.

Data on air quality monitoring is submitted to authorities through an annual emissions summary and dispersion 
monitoring report.

OUR 2023 PERFORMANCE*
Direct Group emissions of SO2 were 31 507 tonnes 
(2022: 34 847 tonnes). Zimplats operations contributed 78% 
(2022: 84%) (smelter with no SO2 abatement equipment) of 
total direct SO2 emissions, while Impala Rustenburg and 
Impala Refineries contributed 22% (smelter with SO2 
abatement equipment and coal-fired boilers with SO2 
abatement equipment, respectively) (2022: 16%).

Introduction Group overviewLeadership reviewsGovernanceOur social performanceOur environmental performanceAppendixMineral waste management

We continue to focus on ensuring the integrity and safety of our storage facilities and strive to increase 
levels of waste mineral recovery and reuse. 

HIGHLIGHTS

•  An independent tailings review board review of Group’s 

tailings storage facilities (TSFs) found no significant areas 
of concern

•  Phase 1 of the project to extend the Zimplats SMC TSF, 

which commenced in 2022, is progressing well. The 
extension is being done in line with GISTM, with initial 
tailings deposition starting in 2023

•  Completed relocation of seven families in the zone of 

influence of the SMC TSF at Zimplats

•  At Impala Canada, site reviews for the new TSF are 

underway

•  Re-mining of tailings at Impala Rustenburg’s dormant TSFs 

was ramped up to 10 000 tonnes per day (2022: 7 000 
tonnes/day) in accordance with plans

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Growing need to establish host community programmes 

on waste streams to create employment opportunities
•  TSF re-mining activities impacted by load curtailment

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024

•  Identify and realise opportunities to use mineral waste to 

generate value in support of the circular economy

•  Progress work to achieve GISTM compliance

OUR APPROACH
Our Group tailings management practices are aligned with the 
GISTM. We consider the GISTM the best practice assurance 
system to use. We follow it to achieve continuous improvement – 
and- to go beyond compliance. 

A Group tailings management policy is in place, as well as a 
Group-wide minimum standard aligned to the GISTM, which 
applies to all existing and future tailings facilities. The standard has 
significantly assisted the industry as a whole to achieve strong 
social, environmental and technical outcomes.

We engage impacted and affected stakeholders throughout the 
lifecycles of our TSFs, from design to closure and beyond.

EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT
All our tailings facilities are technically sound and operate well. 
Implats has nine TSFs at Group-managed operations, of which six 
are active: one at Impala Rustenburg, one at Marula, two at 
Zimplats and two at Impala Canada. Our three inactive TSFs are at 
Impala Rustenburg, Impala Canada and Marula, respectively.

Implats’ TSFs are all upstream, raised, wet-
deposition, ring-dyke structures.

Upstream tailings dams are built progressively “upstream” of the 
starter dam by incorporating tailings materials into the dam for 
support through the controlled deposition, or spigotting of tailings. 
Upstream tailings dams have been built for over a hundred years, 
and their design has evolved with improved construction practices 
and a better understanding of the potential for the static and 
dynamic liquefaction of tailings materials. They are best suited for 
arid climates and aseismic regions like southern Africa where less 
water is stored in the impoundment (see Best Practice for Tailings 
Dam Design). Surface water is drained from the Implats TSFs 
through central decant structures and see page in the tailings 
mass is controlled through drains in and under the tailings mass. 

The primary integrity risk for our upstream 
tailings facilities is an excess accumulation of 
surface water on the TSF basin, which could 
cause dam overtopping and potentially cause 
erosion of the TSF side slopes, resulting in an 
uncontrolled release of the wet tailings. Our 
dams are designed with reinforcements in 
place to cater for such circumstances and 
are operated and monitored according to 
standardised operating procedures within 
the required safety stability factor. 

Fraser Alexander, a company owned by the Royal Bofokeng 
Nation, continues to manage our tailings dams in southern Africa. 
In addition to our own operational controls to oversee the operator, 
independent consultants, SRK, provide oversight and undertake 
design audits. The potential impacts of climate change and 
excessive rainfall are considered in our tailings management 
practices, tailings management reviews and in the design of new 
facilities. 

We engage with people living near our TSFs as part of our holistic 
approach to safety, with each facility having an emergency 
preparedness plan that is reviewed annually. We continue to 
conduct annual simulations to test our emergency response 
readiness and communications protocols and have mapped the 

potential impact on mine communities and mine infrastructure in 
the zone of influence at each facility in case of failure. The likelihood 
of this is, however, extremely low given the significant safety 
measures we have in place.

To fully comply with the GISTM, further social engagement is 
required; this includes social impact assessments, communication 
and stakeholder engagements, and long-term recovery elements, 
in accordance with our tailings management policy. Impala 
Rustenburg, Marula and Zimplats have completed their phase one 
social impact assessments and communication and engagement 
implementation. Phase two is on track to close gaps through 
internal workshops. Phase three will involve sharing plans with 
external emergency services (police, hospitals and municipalities) 
and collaborating with these entities to ensure sufficient awareness 
of action plans is in place to facilitate effective implementation in 
the case of such an emergency response being required. We have 
had success with the Zimplats communities who are actively 
involved with mock drills. Mock drills involve formalised training of 
communities on the correct response, including evacuations, to an 
emergency event involving tailings.

DEVELOPMENTS AT OUR OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF 
OUR STRATEGY
Our operational alignment with the GISTM is excellent, and we 
have exceeded expectations with respect to some of the 
requirements. We created a roadmap to achieve full compliance 
and expect to fully comply and conform with the GISTM by June 
2025. Our goal is to achieve conformance to GISTM through the 
execution of detailed plans and comprehensive assessments, 
which will include engagements with the communities surrounding 
our facilities.

An independent tailings review board reviews 
the Group’s tailings facilities annually. No 
significant areas of concern were highlighted 
this financial year.

INDUSTRY-LEADING RESEARCH – DEFORMATION 
ANALYSIS OF TAILINGS DAMS
Many of the PGM tailings dams in South Africa and Zimbabwe are 
historically constructed on clay foundations, including those in use 
by Implats. 

To ensure the future sustainability and ongoing feasibility of its 
TSFs, Impala Rustenburg is currently conducting industry-leading 
research into the clay material underlying its No 4 tailings dam, with 
the aim of achieving continual improvement in terms of slope 
stability and see page management.

The research involves extensive and advanced laboratory testing of 
the clay in combination with cone penetration testing, a full 
geophysical survey and probabilistic seismic hazard assessment to 
predict the stress/strain behaviour of the clay under current and 
future loading conditions. The findings will provide the industry with 
key learnings. 

RE-MINING MINERAL WASTE DEPOSITS IN RUSTENBURG
Implats aims to reprocess mineral waste streams (where feasible) 
to extract PGMs, alter the post-mining landscape, and deliver 
circular economy value. At Impala Rustenburg, re-mining tailings at 
the dormant TSF continues to ensure host-community 
beneficiation from the project through a joint venture reclamation 
company established with the Luka community. 

Fraser Alexander is assisting with this 
project. The re-mining project has created 
55 permanent jobs, mainly for host community 
members. About 10 000 tonnes are re-
mined daily. The facility uses a closed circuit 
water system, using only reclaimed water, 
ensuring no environmental pollution or potable 
water use. 

The project is anticipated to continue for another 12 years. The 
progressive removal of the tailings facility and land rehabilitation 
process, with further community involvement, will provide available 
land (up to 82ha) and reduce dust pollution, as well as reduce mine 
closure liabilities.

Non-mineral waste

RELOCATION OF FAMILIES IN TSF ZONE OF INFLUENCE AT ZIMPLATS 

Zimplats is pleased with the successful relocation of seven families that were settled within the zone of 
influence of the Selous Metallurgical Complex’s (SMC) TSF potentially putting them, their property and 
livestock, at risk in the case of a TSF breach. 

We engage independent, specialised third-party waste service providers to find innovative new ways 
to decrease the amount of waste sent to landfill.

Zimplats constructed housing and amenities for the families at 
a cost of R7.1 million (US$400 000), with the seven families 
assuming occupancy in June 2023. There is no better way to 
demonstrate Zimplats’ purpose of creating a better future than 
the new structures, which are in sharp contrast with the old 
dwellings that had been occupied by these families since 
2001 when they were resettled by the government within 
the TSF’s zone of influence. The new houses boast at least 
equivalent floor area and are built to a better standard than 
the old pole and mud huts. 

All seven families were engaged on the relocation in line with 
local and World Bank guidelines, see page 38. 

The Chemical and physical properties of PGM tailings are 
conducive to rapid soil formation. Indeed, soil formation may 
be accelerated and guided by targeted amendments. 

A soil building project was initiated on a 3ha portion on the 
“beach” of the dormant Marula tailings dam. The main aim of 
the project is to create topsoil within the sterile “soil” medium 
present in the tailings dam. 

The results of the project thus far are truly remarkable compared 
to non-treated areas.

A second trial which included the planting of perennial grass 
(Bana grass) along the contour banks of the tailings dam, has 
started to establish windbreaks to minimise dust pollution 
emanating from the tailings dam. 

ALKALINE TAILINGS AND MINE WASTE

Our tailings are alkaline in nature and have a significantly less negative impact on biodiversity than acidic 
tailings associated with gold mining. Our tailings and mining activities do not contribute to acid mine drainage. 
Alkaline tailings and mine wastes are globally significant soil-forming substrates.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  High level of compliance with waste licence requirements 

•  72% non-mineral waste diverted from landfill against a 

across our operations

target of 85% by 2030

•  Zimplats consistently recycles and reuses over 80% of the 

non-mineral waste it generates

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Increasing need to divert waste streams from landfills due 

to diminishing landfill capacities in southern Africa 

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024

•  Actively pursue partnerships in our communities to increase 

recycling of non-mineral waste and drive economic 
development

GRI 306-4

OUR APPROACH 
Our ultimate goal is to divert all of our non-mineral waste from 
landfills by 2040 through self-sustaining circular economy initiatives 
that create jobs for our communities. Our operations focus on 
retaining their waste licences by ensuring compliance with 
statutory requirements and site-specific conditions.

We have waste licences in place for Impala Rustenburg (landfill site 
and salvage yard) and for the salvage yards at our Marula and 
Impala Refineries operations, which undertake annual external 
compliance audits. Zimplats has a valid waste licence to store and 
dispose waste generated by mining and processing operations. 
The operations have renewed their effluent, solid waste, radiation 
and hazardous substances’ import licences.

In Canada, the general and domestic waste generated by our 
operation is landfilled on-site during winter, from November to 
May, and is taken off-site by a licensed contractor in the summer 
months when necessary and disposed of in the contractor’s landfill 
site in Thunder Bay. We use a formalised system for tracking and 
reporting off-site waste disposal and recycling streams, with waste 
reporting requirements aligned to those of the Group.

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN WASTE PROGRAMMES – 
CIRCULAR ECONOMY INITIATIVES 
Our established initiatives that were covered in detail in last year’s 
reporting continue to thrive. At Impala Rustenburg, the licensed 
waste management facility (salvage yard) is operated by a local 
company with approximately 85 employees, predominantly from 
the local communities. All the waste collected through the salvage 
yard operations is sorted and sold to pre-approved waste recyclers 
across the country. 

Impala Rustenburg also owns a general waste landfill site, which 
accepts domestic waste from the surrounding communities. It is 
operated by a local, 100% black-owned company which has 11 
employees, predominantly from the local community. Although the 
purpose of this site is disposal, small-scale recycling is undertaken 
on-site by the contractor. 

Our processing operations at Impala Rustenburg 
continue to screen and capture woodchips from 
timber support poles that enter the plant with 
the underground ore. These woodchips are used 
for the concurrent rehabilitation of the tailings 
dam side slopes. The application of the 
woodchips onto the slopes is done by a local 
women-owned and operated company that 
employs approximately 25 people from the local 
community. 

At Marula, the collection and re-use of oil drums continues to support 
the livelihoods of 25 young people from local host communities. 

In Zimbabwe, community-based organisations 
(CBOs) and other enterprises have assisted 
Zimplats to consistently divert 90% of non-
mineral waste from landfill in the past three 
years. The waste material includes conveyor 
belts, scrap metal, plastic material, paper and 
wood. Zimplats also runs vermicomposting 
projects for food waste produced within the 
operations. This is a process in which 
earthworms convert organic materials into a 
humus-like material, known as vermicompost, 
for producing a sustainable harvest of organic 
manure used as fertilizer for rehabilitation 
programmes. This reduces the amount of 
chemical fertilizer used. 

Other noteworthy initiatives are summarised overleaf.

Zimplats

All used tyres at Impala are correctly disposed through a contract with a service provider. Dryer ash from our 
smelting operation in Rustenburg is collected as an input material by a Rustenburg-based brickmaking company. 
Impala Rustenburg procures bricks from this company for on-site construction purposes.

Fly ash from the Refineries operation continues to be used in brickmaking plants.

Plans are in place to establish a charcoal plant from waste timber, which will be operated and managed by a local 
host community company. Paper, cardboard boxes, scrap metals and conveyor belt collection and recycling are 
ring-fenced for local host community companies.

Zimplats continues to work with communities to promote an anti-littering culture and responsible waste disposal, as 
well as to seek partnerships to increase recycling of non-mineral waste and drive sustainable economic 
development, both during operations and after mine closure.

The project to investigate alternative uses of slag, in partnership with the Chinhoyi University of Technology, is 
progressing well. Paving blocks, sample bricks and concrete blocks have been produced from the furnace slag 
mixtures. Planning is underway for pilot testing of these slag products at Zimplats, with commercialisation the 
ultimate goal. The 1.5km road constructed using slag and waste rock at Zimplats, featured in last year’s report, 
continues to demonstrate its robustness in all weather conditions. Plans are in place to construct other roads using 
this waste material.

Impala Canada

Impala Canada has established a collection and management system for used tyres through a partnership with 
a local company, Fountain Tyre. The operation retreads (re-uses) a significant amount of tyres, diverting them from 
landfill and significantly reducing environmental impacts.

disposed to landfill (2022: 31%). Our goal remains to achieve 85% non-mineral waste diverted from landfills by 2030.  

Mine closure and rehabilitation

Through integrated closure planning and concurrent rehabilitation, we strive for our mines to leave a 
positive, healthy and sustainable legacy.

HIGHLIGHTS

•  Impala Rustenburg’s progressive shaft closure, 

decommissioning and rehabilitation programme continues 
to deliver satisfactory results

•  The Group has fully funded the net present value of 

environmental obligations at Impala Refineries and Impala 
Rustenburg. The Group is also in the process of fully 
funding the environmental obligations for Marula

•  The rehabilitation of the old pits at Zimplats is progressing 

well  

•  Rehabilitated 11.33ha of eligible land at Group-managed 

operations (2022: 11ha)

LOWLIGHTS/CHALLENGES

•  Continued policy uncertainty in South Africa due to further 
delays in the implementation of new legislation governing 
mine closure and the new financial provision regulations

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2024

•  Implement concurrent rehabilitation to reduce closure 

liabilities and improve rehabilitation outcomes

OUR APPROACH
We understand that a mine has social and environmental impacts 
long after the end of its operational phase.

Our approach to ensuring responsible mine closure emphasises 
the importance of designing, planning and operating a mine with 
closure in mind. In doing so, we aim to reduce long-term risks and 
liabilities to our business from an environmental and socio-
economic perspective, and to ensure that we leave a positive 
legacy when our mines conclude their operational lives. 

All our mining operations have closure plans in 
place. These plans are reviewed annually, and 
the closure liabilities and applicable financial 
provisions are updated accordingly. Conducting 
concurrent rehabilitation ensures that we 
reduce the end-of-life closure liability – 
ensuring effective rehabilitation is an 
important regulatory, financial and reputational 
issue for the Company. 

Our efforts around mine closure and rehabilitation continue to focus 
on ensuring a sustainable post-mining legacy from the project 
planning phase onwards, working with our stakeholders to address 
social impacts, managing our closure liabilities and rehabilitating 
the land around our operations when operations cease. We 
continuously investigate alternative post-closure land uses that are 
aligned with our host communities’ expectations and support 
economic opportunities after mining.

Closure liability and financial provision
Closure liability assessments are based on identified closure risks 
at each operation and developing a mitigation plan over the 
remaining life of operation. Responsibility for financial provisioning 
and funding lies with the Group CFO and our HSE committee 
oversees our approach and performance in managing these 
impacts.

In South Africa, our assessment protocols and methodology align 
with the country’s regulations relating to the financial provision for 
prospecting, exploration, mining or production operations. As 
stated in our 2022 ESG report, the revised National Environmental 
Management Act (NEMA) financial provision regulations were 
extended to September 2023.

CLOSURE LIABILITY ASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS

South Africa

Zimplats

In South Africa, our assessment protocols and methodology are already closely aligned with the National 
Environmental Management Act (NEMA) financial provision regulations relating to the financial provision for 
prospecting, exploration, mining or production and closure.

Zimplats conducts annual closure liability assessments aligned with the Group’s assessment methodology and 
protocols, and the operation’s closure liability estimates were reviewed by independent closure planning experts 
and updated this year. 

Impala Canada

Impala Canada has initiated a new closure plan to include the new tailings expansion. The updated closure plan 
and the associated increase to financial provisions are currently under review by regulatory agencies.

REHABILITATION
We continue to look for alternative post-closure land uses that are aligned with our host communities’ expectations and support economic 
opportunities after mining ceases. Effective rehabilitation is also a key regulatory, financial and reputational issue for the Group.

As the technical aspects of rehabilitation are becoming more critical, landscape function analysis, which is aimed at measuring functionality 
and sustainability, is used as a monitoring tool at the rehabilitated opencast sites at the Impala Rustenburg operation as well as the 
rehabilitated tailings side slopes at Impala Rustenburg and Marula. This monitoring will continue throughout 2023 and expand to the 
rehabilitated shaft complexes at Impala Rustenburg. The current expected Group cost to restore the environmental disturbances for 
regulatory compliance purposes, as estimated by third-party experts, is R5 526 million. Group’s rehabilitation investments, which should 
over time result in fully funded
guarantees at the end of life-of-mine, increased to R2.5 billion (2022: R1.4 billion) and guarantees issues to the regulators in respect of 
environmental rehabilitation liabilities increased to R3.6 billion (2022: R2.6 billion). The provision for environmental rehabilitation also 
increased to R2.7 billion (2022: R2.3 billion).

Financial guarantees concerning environmental rehabilitation are submitted to the DMRE for the South African operations and projects, to 
satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Management Act. Third-party experts, E-Tek Consulting conducted these 
assessments for Impala Rustenburg and Marula, and SRK for RBPlat.

In line with DMRE mine-closure requirements, the South African liabilities are secured through insurance policies and bank guarantees. Only 
bank and insurance guarantees are currently used as financial provisions. Similar arrangements are in place in Zimbabwe and Canada.

Rehabilitation programmes
All our operations in South Africa and Zimbabwe have concurrent rehabilitation plans that include revegetation, dust management and water 
management.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS

Impala 
Rustenburg

Impala 
Refineries

Marula

Zimplats

Impala 
Canada

Impala Rustenburg has a progressive shaft closure decommissioning and rehabilitation project in place, with the 
first phase of the project completed in 2023. Most of the structural steel was removed from the 2A and 8 Shafts, 
with demolition of the concrete structures such as buildings, plinths and floors progressing well. The shafts are 
scheduled to be fully rehabilitated during the year, including the remediation of contaminated surface and/or 
underground areas. The final grassing and amelioration will be completed in the wet season after rehabilitation 
activities. Although we have a statutory obligation to restore land to grazing as a minimum, we are constantly 
reviewing and aligning our post-closure land use in consultation with stakeholders.

We appointed a host community black-female owned company to carry out our shaft rehabilitation programme. 
Once a shaft or portions of a shaft have been rehabilitated, the associated closure liability will be updated. This will 
have a positive financial impact on the quantum of the rehabilitation obligation. Reclaimed assets will be reused at 
other shafts or sold, with the resale value being used to offset rehabilitation costs.

This operation has applied to subdivide the surface area linked to an old gold mining-related tailings dam footprint. 
This has been done to expedite rehabilitation efforts, which remain contractually the responsibility of the previous 
operator (gold mining company). 

The topsoil generation project at the operation’s decommissioned TSF, aimed at mitigating water erosion and 
preventing dust from being generated, continues to yield positive results (see page 116). 

Zimplats’ concurrent rehabilitation of impacted land involves the revegetation of rehabilitated pits with indigenous 
grass seed and the monitoring of established vegetation.

The rehabilitation of the old open pits at Ngezi continues to progress well. The programme rehabilitated 10ha of 
land with the planting of indigenous grass and trees (2022: 10 ha) and 0.4 million loose cubic metres of soil were 
moved for backfilling (2022: 0.4 million).

Zimplats also planted 1 850 tree saplings (2022: 2 350) on its TSFs. The revegetation covered 1.3 ha (2022:1.6 ha).

Impala Canada and Fort William First Nation worked together to complete the first phase of the closure 
requirements at the Shebandowan Mine site, a 50:50 joint venture between Vale Canada and Impala Canada. 
Impala Canada has invested approximately C$800 000 to bring the landscape back to its original natural condition. 
In late spring of 2023, the second phase of closure began with Fort William First Nation leading the selection of 
seed mixtures and tree seedlings for Shebandowan West. Local topsoil will be used in the process. Going forward, 
Impala Canada will conduct annual water testing at the site, as defined by the closure plan.

OUR APPROACH
As custodians of our ecosystems, we seek to improve the 
biodiversity footprint of our operations by implementing initiatives to 
avoid and reduce the loss of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystems, 
while delivering sustainable environmental value for our host 
communities.

We determine the biodiversity impacts of our 
mining operations through our environmental 
authorisation processes, and we manage these 
according to site-specific biodiversity 
management plans and standards. We 
continuously undertake dedicated projects to 
improve biodiversity and compliance with 
legislation.

Our efforts to reduce the disturbance and loss of biodiversity, 
habitats and ecosystems are underpinned by ongoing rehabilitation 
and concurrent revegetation of open pit and TSF facilities. We are 
committed to preserving biodiversity-rich ecosystems, protecting 
wildlife species, controlling the impact of invasive alien vegetation, 
and preventing deforestation, which includes specific clauses in our 
timber supply contracts to ensure responsible sourcing. 
GRI 304-3

BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT
Over the next five years, we plan initiatives to align to our 2030 
biodiversity goals to obtain 100% alignment with the Group closure 
and rehabilitation policy and guideline.

We monitor and measure performance against a formal biodiversity management plan informed by the Mining and 
Biodiversity Guideline developed by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI). Our annual biodiversity 
monitoring programmes are undertaken by external biodiversity specialists (scientists registered with the South 
African Council for Natural Scientific Professionals). The programmes are not only designed to monitor and provide 
reactive commentary, but also to provide recommendations for remediating poor-performing areas.

The operations are near the Blesbokspruit, a designated Ramsar Convention Wetland of International Importance. 
Although our operation does not have any direct impact on the wetlands, it continues to partner in environmental 
education and conservation initiatives in the area.

Marula has appointed and trained two local companies to conduct on-site AIS identification and eradication 
projects. The operation runs annual AIS assessment and refresher training on species identification, while aquatic 
biomonitoring is conducted biannually.

The Zimplats mine lease area includes a 276ha section of land within the Ngezi Recreational Park’s boundary. Our 
rehabilitation and mine closure activities comply with the conditions outlined by the Ministry of Environment in the 
lease agreement regarding the protection and restoration of biodiversity in the lease area.

The operation’s main control measure against deforestation is the land and vegetation clearance permitting system 
administered by the Company’s own rehabilitation procedure. Vegetation loss is compensated for through offset 
initiatives where trees must be replaced on a 1:1 basis as a minimum. Measures and practices in place to mitigate 
deforestation include collecting seeds of important plant species ahead of planned projects, revegetation initiatives, 
conducting awareness training sessions for employees and contractors and participating in and supporting 
national tree-planting programmes.

Site clearing activities at the Zimplats 35MW renewable energy plant progressed in 2023. Due care is carried out to 
ensure that the wildlife impacted is relocated to a suitable habitat. A total of 79 snakes were relocated to the 
wilderness in support of the operation’s biodiversity plan.

A species at risk (SAR) survey was carried out at Lac des Iles Mine. Two SAR were observed within the Lac des 
Iles Mine site: Bank Swallow (threatened) and Little Brown Myotis (endangered). Bank Swallow nesting habitat 
present on the mine site is well-defined. Potential Little Brown Myotis roosting habitat (in the form of forest 
fragments and buildings) is abundant on-site, however, suitable hibernacula appear to be absent. Impala Canada 
has implemented mitigation measures to reduce or avoid impacts on the SAR and will engage with authorities to 
evaluate the need for additional studies, monitoring, or mitigation measures.

ARBOR WEEK TREE PLANTINGS AT MARULA

Trees help clean the air we breathe, filter the water we drink, and are home to over 80% of the world’s 
land-based biodiversity. 

It was also intended to sensitise employees and communities to 
the need to conserve, protect and plant indigenous trees for 
environmental and human ideals. Since September is also 
Heritage Month in South Africa, Marula celebrated 2022’s 
champion tree – the African Wattle (Peltophorum africanum), 
known as Mosehla in Sepedi.

Trees absorb harmful carbon and release oxygen back into the 
atmosphere. They provide jobs, supply us with materials for 
tools, shelter and furniture and are the key ingredients in roughly 
25% of all medicines.

National Arbor Month in September is a campaign aimed at 
raising awareness about the importance of trees and to 
encourage everyone in South Africa to plant indigenous trees for 
sustainable environmental management.

Marula’s environmental department encouraged tree planting at 
the operation and among young learners at host community 
schools. Marula trees and fruit trees were planted to highlight the 
important role trees play.

Directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for the selection, preparation and 
presentation of the selected KPIs in accordance with the 
accompanying Implats reporting criteria. This responsibility includes 
the identification of stakeholders and stakeholder requirements, 
material issues, commitments with respect to sustainability 
performance and design, implementation and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation of the Report that is free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The 
directors are also responsible for determining the appropriateness 
of the measurement and reporting criteria in view of the intended 
users of the selected KPIs and for ensuring that those criteria are 
publicly available to the Report users.

Inherent limitations
Non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent 
limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of the 
subject matter and the methods used for determining, calculating, 
sampling and estimating such information. The absence of a 
significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for 
the selection of certain different but acceptable measurement 
techniques, which can result in different measurements and can 
impact comparability. Qualitative interpretations of relevance, 
materiality and the accuracy of data are subject to individual 
assumptions and judgements. The precision thereof may change 
over time. It is important to read the report in the context of the 
reporting criteria. 

In particular, where the information relies on factors derived by 
independent third parties, our assurance work has not included an 
examination of the derivation of those factors and other third-party 
information.

Our independence and quality control
We have complied with the independence and other ethical 
requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct for Registered 
Auditors issued by the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors 
(IRBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of 
integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour. The IRBA Code is 
consistent with the corresponding sections of the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of 
Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International 
Independence Standards). 

Nexia SAB&T Inc and Khulagro Inc apply the International Standard 
on Quality Management 1, which requires the firms to design, 
implement and operate a system of quality management including 
policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements. 

Auditors’ responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express either a reasonable assurance 
opinion or limited assurance conclusion on the selected KPIs as 
set out in table (a) and (b) of the Subject Matter paragraph, based 
on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have 
obtained. We conducted our assurance engagement in 
accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements 
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, 
issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards 
Board. That Standard requires that we plan and perform our

engagement to obtain the appropriate level of assurance about 
whether the selected KPIs are free from material misstatement. 

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary 
in nature and timing, and are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement. As a result the level of assurance obtained 
in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the 
assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a 
reasonable assurance engagement.

(a) Reasonable assurance
A reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 
3000 (Revised) involves performing procedures to obtain evidence 
about the measurement of the selected KPIs and related 
disclosures in the Report. The nature, timing and extent of 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s professional 
judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the selected KPIs, whether due to fraud or error. 

In making those risk assessments we have considered internal 
control relevant to Implats preparation of the selected KPIs. 
A reasonable assurance engagement also includes: 
•  Evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods, 

reporting policies and internal guidelines used and the 
reasonableness of estimates made by Implats;

•  Assessing the suitability in the circumstances of Implats use of 

the applicable reporting criteria as a basis for preparing the 
selected information; and

performance information 

internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the 
assessed risks. Accordingly, for the KPIs where limited assurance 
was obtained, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion 
about whether Implats selected KPIs have been prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the accompanying Implats 
reporting criteria. 

The procedures we performed were based on our professional 
judgement and included inquiries, observation of processes 
followed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, 
evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and 
reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying 
records.

Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the 
procedures listed above we:
•  Interviewed management and senior executives to obtain an 

understanding of the internal control environment, risk 
assessment process and information systems relevant to the 
sustainability reporting process; 

•  Inspected documentation to corroborate the statements of 

management and senior executives in our interviews;

•  Tested the processes and systems to generate, collate, 

aggregate, monitor and report the selected KPIs;

•  Performed a controls walkthrough of identified key controls;
•  Inspected supporting documentation on a sample basis and 

performed analytical procedures to evaluate the data generation 
and reporting processes against the reporting criteria;

estimates and judgments made by the directors in the 
preparation of the selected KPIs; and

•  Evaluating the overall presentation of the selected sustainability 

•  Evaluated the reasonableness and appropriateness of significant 

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance 
opinion. 

•  Evaluated whether the selected KPIs presented in the Report are 

consistent with our overall knowledge and experience of 
sustainability management and performance at Implats.

(b) Limited assurance
A limited assurance engagement undertaken in accordance with 
ISAE 3000 (Revised) involves assessing the suitability in the 
circumstances of Implats use of its reporting criteria as the basis of 
preparation for the selected KPIs, assessing the risks of material 
misstatement of the selected KPIs whether due to fraud or error, 
responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the 
circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the 
selected KPIs. A limited assurance engagement is substantially 
less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation 
to both risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of 

Reasonable assurance opinion and limited assurance 
conclusion
(a) Reasonable assurance opinion
In our opinion and subject to the inherent limitations outlined 
elsewhere in this report, the selected KPIs set out in section (a) of 
the Subject Matter paragraph above for the year ended 
30 June 2023 are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance 
with the accompanying Implats reporting criteria.

(b) Limited assurance conclusion
Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we 
have obtained and subject to the inherent limitations outlined 
elsewhere in this report, nothing has come to our attention that 
causes us to believe that the selected KPIs as set out in section (b) 
of the Subject Matter paragraph above for the year ended 
30 June 2023 are not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with the accompanying Implats reporting criteria.

Other matters
The maintenance and integrity of the Implats website is the 
responsibility of Implats management. Our procedures did not 
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept 
no responsibility for any changes to either the information in the 
Report or our independent assurance report that may have 
occurred since the initial date of its presentation on the Implats 
website. 

Restriction of liability
Our work has been undertaken to enable us to express either a 
reasonable assurance opinion or a limited assurance conclusion on 
the selected KPIs to the directors of Implats in accordance with the 
terms of our engagement, and for no other purpose. We do not 
accept or assume liability to any party other than Implats, for our 
work, for this report, or for the conclusion we have reached.
