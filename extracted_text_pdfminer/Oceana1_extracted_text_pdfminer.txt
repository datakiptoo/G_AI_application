OUR CAPITALS

The resources and relationships on which we depend, can be 
conceived as different forms of ‘capital stocks and flows’ – the 
assets we need to protect and enhance to achieve our strategic 
objectives. We make trade-offs between our capitals, as discussed 
on pages 8 and 9. 

Natural Capital: The long-term sustainability of 
the marine resources that we harvest is critical to 
our existence. We measure and manage our impact 
on the environment in an effort to reduce this to a 
minimum.

Human Capital: Our performance-driven culture 
– that positively impacts lives with the correct 
reward, motivation, and development of each 
employee, and that protects their health, safety 
and wellbeing – is critical to achieve our purpose. 

Social and Relationship Capital: Our 
relationships with our stakeholders, including 
the communities in which we operate is vital in 
ensuring long-term sustainability of our business. 
We recognise the role the fishing industry plays in 
building a thriving society.

Manufactured Capital: Our fleet, processing 
plants, cold storage and equipment, products and 
information technology, provide the framework 
and mechanics of how we do business.

Intellectual Capital: Our brand value, research 
and development, innovation capacity, 
reputation, and strategic partnerships underpin 
our organisation. We strive to uphold the highest 
ethical standards and regulatory compliance. 

Financial Capital: Efficient management of 
our shareholders’ equity and funding from 
investors and lenders to support our business and 
operational activities, including working capital.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022About this report

PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT
Oceana Group Limited’s (hereafter referred to as Oceana or the Group) 2022 sustainability 
report provides a review of the Group’s performance and prospects in relation to 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that have a material impact on the 
long-term success of the business. It aims to reflect the way sustainability is integrated 
into our business in accordance with current and emerging disclosure guidance 
relevant to our operating geographies. The report should be read in conjunction 
with our Integrated Annual Report 2022.

TARGET AUDIENCE
While this report is of potential interest to all our existing and prospective stakeholders, 
it is focused primarily on addressing the interests of government officials, socially 
responsible investment analysts and investors, as well as sustainability professionals.

MATERIALITY
Sustainability issues are identified based on a review and assessment of how we 
create value, the impact of the broad operating context on value creation, the 
material interests of our stakeholders, and the principal risks facing the Group. This 
review is undertaken annually by selected decision-makers across the organisation 
and supplemented if required. ESG risks are identified and addressed as part of 
an ongoing, structured approach to risk management. Risks are managed within a 
unitary framework that is aligned with our corporate governance responsibilities. 

Further information on our materiality process is provided in our Integrated Report.

SCOPE AND BOUNDARY
Unless otherwise stated, all sustainability-related reports cover the full business 
operations of the Group, which comprises subsidiaries in the fishing, commercial 
cold storage and logistics industries in South Africa, the United States and Namibia. 
Since last year there have been no significant changes to the Group’s organisational 
structure.

The reporting period is for the financial year ended 30 September 2022. Unless 
otherwise  stated,  all  performance  data  is  for  the  12-month  reporting  period.  
There have been no significant restatements of ESG data during the year. 

The spectrum of issues addressed in the report is determined by our materiality review. 

For material information relating to the Group’s overall strategy, governance practices 
and performance, please refer to our Integrated Report, available on our website 
(http://oceana.co.za/investors/integrated-reports/). Supplementary information 
is provided in our Consolidated Annual Financial Statements (AFS) 2022, scientific 
reports for the species harvested, and our carbon footprint assessment report (CFAR) 
2022, all available on our website (www.oceana.co.za).

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022PARTNERING FOR  INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENTENERGY SECURITY AND  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENTOCEANA PEOPLE: ENABLING ACTIONRESPONDING TO  COMMUNITY NEEDS APPENDICESLetter from the Chief Executive Officer 

Resilience is not born from ease and 
tough challenges are no guarantee 
of breakthrough.

We opened the year in the face of intense governance pressures and 
low inventory levels. The latter were compounded as global events 
drove up prices for fuel and freight. Raw material and input costs for 
our affordable canned offerings rose dramatically, including steel and 
tomato paste. We knew that any attempt to recover through consumer 
price increases would push many families towards less nutritious 
options. We held the line, with mid-year results showing a 37% decline 
in operating profit and an 11% drop in revenue. 

Our turnaround in the past six 
months has been no less significant. 
Sustained by a strong demand for 
fish and fish oil (particularly from 
aquafeed producers), our rapid 
recovery required a concerted effort 
across the value chain.

We found leverage in geographic diversification (Daybrook delivered 
a particularly strong performance, with good weather conditions 
contributing to a 35% increase in fish landings over the previous year) 
and Global Pilchard sourcing to expand our local canning production 
at Lucky Star

Prudent management of the consequent economies of scale; and 
innovation, particularly in affordable, high-protein canned foods, which 
achieved market share quickly through our iconic Lucky Star brand. 

To separate out so-called ‘environmental’, ‘social’ and ‘governance’ 
factors  within  this  dynamic  operating  environment  is  virtually 
impossible. I doubt it is really necessary, despite the fact that it is 
important for disclosure purposes. Our experience this year has 
validated the many steps taken towards sustainability integration over 
the past decade. It has also led teams across the Group to redouble 
their drive for effective integration of sustainability considerations in 
day-to-day decisions, actions and communications.

Our business strategy is positioned for long-term, sustainable growth. 
It leverages the strengths of our existing portfolio, focusing on three 
areas of strategic growth. In each case, our drive is towards quality 
growth, not only quantity.

Firstly, the bedrock of our broad-based consumer strategy, Lucky Star, 
delivers affordable protein. Staying true to our purpose, our teams are 
working: to keep input and production costs low; to scale the market 
by leveraging our iconic brand; and to create new product options 
that deliver affordability and protein, beyond fish. 

Our second growth area focuses on our FMO (fishmeal and fish oil) 
operations, which combine Daybrook in the USA and our local fishmeal 
plants in South Africa. While we remain price takers within these 
commodity markets, they present a massive global market opportunity. 
The Gulf menhaden fishery is not limited by quotas, which presents 
significant opportunity to increase efficiency through technology and 
operational improvements. The ability to land more fish will enable 
us to expand local production in South African fish meal plants, with 
measurable socio-economic benefits. The tremendous global growth 
in aquaculture will continue to drive demand for both fishmeal and oil.

Our third growth area is in wild caught seafood. Increasing demand 
worldwide for high quality, healthy wild-caught seafood is driving 
solid margin growth. While governed by quotas, our fisheries are fairly 
stable and well managed. Through responsible fishing, we seek to 
protect our quotas and optimise value, with potential to grow through 
acquisitions and partnerships. 

Strategic growth is clearly integral to our ability to ‘positively impact 
lives’, and vice versa. Our Group sustainability team has contributed 
to this steady integration throughout the year, and I’ve seen growing 
recognition for the role of sustainability practice across the group. 

We have experienced tragedy this year as a person lost their life in a 
workplace incident. We have extended our heartfelt condolences to the 
families. This incident was fully investigated, and no negligence was 
found on the part of Desert Diamond Fishing. We remain steadfastly 
committed to zero harm in the workplace and have implemented 
further safety measures in response to this fatal incident.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTIONThere has also been steady progress on several other fronts during 
the year:
Job security and empowerment remain critical considerations, 
particularly in our Southern African operations. Progress this year 
was achieved through our frozen fish impact strategy, which helped 
us maintain jobs despite significant margin pressures, as well as 
through the Oceana Maritime Academy, which targets skills shortages 
in the sector. This year, we focused strongly on the training needs 
of small-scale fishers, supporting their ability to operate effectively 
within the industry. We remain one of the most black-empowered 
fishing companies in South Africa and one of the most transformed 
companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Food security has become a global concern in the face of pandemic 
setbacks and price increases driven by geo-political conflicts and 
uncertainty. This issue has always topped our sustainability agenda 
because our truly scalable contribution to society lies in our ability to 
deliver quality, affordable protein from responsible sources. We delight 
in knowing that more than 4 million healthy and affordable Lucky Star 
meals are consumed every day. Our teams are increasingly driven to 
innovate in this area, at every stage of the value chain, seeking to extend 
and adapt our capabilities to make a bigger difference in people’s lives.
Responsible harvesting remains a key focus and we continue to draw 
on the insights of our own scientists as well as those of government, 
non-profit organisations and standards bodies. While much of this 
effort is informed by global best practice, fishing responsibly also offers 
opportunity for innovation. We have invested in a technology that limits 
non-targeted by-catch in the mid-water trawl. Data remains critical 
to informed decisions in this area. We continue our commitment to 
ongoing audits of our target species and to making our horse mackerel 
mid-water trawler, Desert Diamond, available for data collection and 
compliance purposes. In addition, as founding members of the 
Responsible Fisheries Alliance, we’ve signed a landmark new five-
year commitment to further enhance responsible fishing practices in 
South Africa, together with WWF, Birdlife and DFFE.

Carbon neutrality is a business obligation and strategic commitment. 
In 2020, we announced our commitment to a 50% reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (off a 2019 baseline) and to carbon 
neutrality by 2050. We made good progress this year. Our 10MW 
solar facility on the West Coast is well underway. We are on track 
to achieve a major reduction in our emissions by converting freon-
based freezing facilities onboard our seven large BCP vessels to other 
suitable refrigerant gas-based systems. To help finance these and other 
investments, we’ve implemented a R1.7 billion five-year debt-facility 
that is overtly tied to ambitious sustainability goals.

Integration can only be embedded through an organisation’s culture. 
I believe we laid important foundations this year through a Group-wide 
values-driven culture and engagement survey. The process was also 
important to rebuild team morale following the negative press the 
Group endured early in the year. Participation in the survey was high; 
feedback was honest and heartening. It has been gratifying to see the 
enthusiasm of our teams for follow-on small focus groups.

As Chief Executive, I reflect on a multitude of systems, relationships, 
data streams and imperatives that must work together to deliver growth 
in support of our purpose. Having worked in the sector for more than 
35 years, I am confident we have the fundamentals in place. I am equally 
certain that we will face further unprecedented pitfalls along the way. 
Given our experience of the past few years, I have little doubt that 
our teams and the stakeholder networks they engage will rise to the 
challenge. I extend my thanks to the Social, Ethics and Transformation 
Committee of the Board, under the chair of Ms Nomahlubi Simamane, 
for their support and oversight.

Our positively impacting lives call to action 
has stood us in good stead for a renewed 
culture and sustainability journey.

As a SETCOM, our oversight role in respect of the group’s true north 
– its agreed principles and the ethics that inform them – has never 
been more important. Since its inception years ago, I have seen an 
acceleration of interest in and demand for the work of this committee. 
Significant impetus has been added with the recent upsurge of investor 
focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and 
growing evidence of investor activism across the world. 

As a committee, we have never seen sustainability as a tick box exercise 
and have always sought a blend of hard and soft skills. Hard skills 
are needed to accord with technical specifications, whether set in 
regulatory controls or still emerging in carbon accounting and scenario 
development. They play a particular role in decisions where issues are 
fraught, where complete information is not always possible, and the 
way forward is not obvious. Given the increasing importance of our 
role. We need to be sure we are asking the right questions, and asking 
enough questions, to bring the requisite perspective to our work. 

During the year, three areas have highlighted for me the importance 
of this perspective in informing Oceana’s progress:
1. A company that is unquestionably purpose led. The ability to 
contribute to food security in Africa and beyond genuinely drives 
Oceana’s people and teams. This potential takes our social senses well 
beyond philanthropy into every part of the core business – finding new 
ways to make a can of responsibly-sourced fish protein more affordable, 
healthier and delicious. Connection is key: part of our journey has 
been learning and appreciating how people – mostly women – use 
and share our iconic Lucky Star products. It has also taken effect in a 
group-wide outreach on values this year.

2. A company committed to increasing opportunity for black women 
in the ocean economy. Transformation remains a pressing issue in 
South Africa and Oceana continues to maintain its Level 1 Broad-Based 
Black Economic Empowerment status. I have no doubt that women 
play an important role in this industry and I think recognition, in 
our annual sustainability report, of the many roles women play – as 
technical officers, fishers and small business owners – supports the 
ambitions of young women who choose to enter the sector.
3. A company focusing more on connections between issues. Silos 
can be efficient and functional, but ESG opportunities – and risks – 
often lie in the way things are connected. In the arid west coast of 
South Africa, it is imperative that we focus on water security.  We have 
invested in our ability to harvest sea water to address this challenge.  
In a similar way, our Maritime Academy develops skills necessary 
for our business and the broader fishing sector, but it also provides 
courses in skills that serve the neighbouring Hout Bay community.

Despite significant progress, I am of the opinion that social and ethical 
oversight remains a work in progress. Some areas require greater 
attention and my team and I will redouble our efforts in seeking the 
progress that is required.
1.  Fisher safety is paramount. Despite our longstanding commitment 
to zero harm, one of the Desert Diamond crew lost his life after a 
workplace incident. While no negligence was found on the part of 
Oceana, it is a stark reminder that safety must be the first condition in 
the face of operational pressures and tightening regulatory conditions. 

1212

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTION2. ESG must be applied across the supply chain. We have made 
significant progress in our climate ambitions, with our commitment 
to Net Zero by 2050 driving tangible investments in renewable energy 
and freezer facility conversions onboard our hake and horse mackerel 
vessels. To make more meaningful progress, our gaze must focus on 
the broader supply chain, recognising the mutual dependencies that 
became so evident during the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. I am 
convinced that there are significant opportunities to learn and to share 
by working at the value chain level.
3. We must progress our ability to measure ESG outcomes. Over the 
past five years, we have focused strongly on aligning with standards 
to ensure we meet our stakeholders’ shifting expectations on ESG 
disclosure. These are important steps but maturing our practice 
requires us to develop further strategic indicators that connect our ESG 
efforts directly to elements of our business model. This will provide an 
essential feedback loop for integrated reporting and the committee 
is committed to providing oversight, support and guidance in this 
respect in the coming year. 

After 75 years on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and with an 
abundance of opportunity to make a difference, I remain inspired 
by what this group continues to achieve and by the contribution I 
and the committee can make in bringing this to fruition. Despite the 
challenges of this year, we are receiving strong positive support from 
our investor community.

Through continued connection 
with all our stakeholder 
communities, I am convinced more 
than ever that we will find a way 
through the inevitable turbulence 
of coming years.

ALIGNING 
WITH THE 
SDGs
The Sustainable 
Development 
Goals (SDGs) 
provide a 
globally agreed 
articulation of 
the imperative 
to end poverty, 
protect 
the planet 
and ensure 
prosperity for 
all by 2030. Our 
sustainability 
framework 
aligns directly 
with five SDGs 
and we stay 
informed on 
the global 
movement 
in support of 
these goals.

Our  ability  to  deliver  on  our  purpose  is  impacted  by  society, 
the environment and the economy. These, in turn, are impacted by 
our decisions and operations. Our strategic sustainability framework 
plays an important role at this dynamic interface:

•  Guiding our decision-making in relation to key impacts, risks 

•  Helping us align with national and global sustainable 

•  Providing a framework for disclosure on our most strategic 

and opportunities.

development goals.

sustainability issues. 

Given increasing investor interest and engagement in ESG, 
integration remains an important focus and we continue 
to mature and deepen our practices.

SUPPORTING THE BUSINESS STRATEGY
There  is  increasing  congruence  between  the  Group’s  growth 
opportunities and our sustainability imperatives, which aligns with 
our strategic imperatives:

•  Our growth beyond fish into the affordable protein market 

enhances our contribution to food security.

•  Our ability to leverage scale and manage input costs makes 
it possible to keep margins low for consumers in the face of 
unemployment and inflation.

•  Our ability to source fish from across the world has made 
it possible to sustain jobs in our canneries while reducing 
pressure on South African fish stocks.

•  Our efficiency and optimisation drives, support increased 

energy resilience and carbon reduction.

Our business strategy recognises the following Strategic Enablers, 
all of which are supported by our sustainability practices:
•  Galvanise the workforce
•  Engage stakeholders and manage reputation
•  Ensure good governance and sustainability.

ZERO HUNGER
The hunger crisis has worsened. Africa 
is the most hungry continent with more 
than 20% of the population experiencing 
hunger. Progress in relation to paediatric 
stunting and wasting have been reversed 
by Covid-19, climate challenges and 
supply constraints due to armed conflict.

NO POVERTY
The pandemic led to the first rise in 
extreme poverty in a generation. The 
Russia-Ukraine war, global stagflation 
and currency fluctuations continue to 
drive up cost pressures, particularly for 
consumers with lower spending power.

CLIMATE ACTION
The climate crisis continues unabated. 
In 2021, the global average temperature 
was 1.04°C above pre-industrial levels. 
Disasters are becoming more frequent 
and more intense as the world warms.

DECENT WORK & ECONOMIC 
GROWTH
While 2022 has seen an improvement 
on the situation in 2021, global 
unemployment is expected to remain 
above pre-COVID-19 levels until at 
least 2023.
LIFE BELOW WATER
Over 3 billion people rely on oceans for 
their livelihoods. Oceans are under 
severe threat from marine pollution, 
ocean warming, acidification; 
eutrophication and fishery collapse.

An engaged and skilled work force is a further key enabler of our business strategy, highlighting the role played by Oceana people and the 
cultures that shape the way we work. Our Culture Journey  is laying the foundation of values and demonstrating the value of engagement. 
We believe values and engagement to be the bedrock of effective and accountable decision-making in the face of large-scale – often 
intractable – sustainability challenges.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE: UNDERLIES AND ENABLES  
SUSTAINABILITY FOCUS AREAS AND RISK MANAGEMENT

Growing in the face of today’s pressures and trends requires innovation and agility. These attributes are critical to sustain and optimise 
productivity in the face of natural resource fluctuations, quota-regulated fisheries and significant input cost pressures. Spurred by the 
pandemic and the recent rise in geo-political conflict, our procurement teams have played a leading role in responding to disruption.  
These efforts are supported by our growing exploration of new technologies in fishing practices and beyond. As sustainability pressures 
increase, we believe the innovative capabilities of all our teams will be integral to our success and we are laying the cultural groundwork 
to support this.

IN 2021, WE PUBLISHED OCEANA GROUP’S LEADERSHIP STATEMENT

We have instilled a purpose-led culture with a meaningful shift towards an 
emerging culture of resilience. Our actions are based on the premise that we live 
in an imbalanced society and that it is our responsibility, as a leader in our sector, 
to contribute to addressing these imbalances in whichever way we can.

•  We, the board members, management and staff, positively impact lives
•  We embrace a diverse Oceana where people participate, thrive and are celebrated 
•  We are energised by the joy of service (to the community, environment, society, customers 

•  We see stakeholders (shareholders, customers, suppliers, staff and communities) as partners  

and colleagues) 

in creating shared value 

•  We are masters of our trade (brilliant at the basics, responsible, focused, diligent and determined) 
•  We relentlessly drive improvement 
•  We remain agile in a world of constant change (environment, economy and consumer)

In 2022, we progressed our culture journey by means of a 
Group-wide engagement survey. Using the Gartner method, we 
actively engaged 3,000 staff as part of a broader intervention 
to define, communicate and embed the Group’s core values 
and to measure engagement levels. We see culture work as 
intrinsic to fulfilling our purpose: by improving team cohesion 
and creating a sense of commitment in the work place, we 
help our teams deliver beyond “the numbers”. 

Participation in the survey was high at 53%, with 65% of those 
surveyed assessed as being “engaged” or “actively engaged”. 
Given the governance challenges and negative press coverage 
earlier in the year, we were pleased that 95% of those surveyed 
felt they could be honest in answering the survey. 

We achieved a positive Employee Net Promoter Score. The 
eNPS is a measure of employee advocacy for the business 
as an employer. It asks employees how likely they are to 
recommend Oceana to other people who currently do not 
work for the business. The survey also identified key areas 
for improvement, including recognition and understanding of 
career paths within the organisation. Each business area will 
deliver action plans to address engagement issues identified 
in the survey.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTIONRefining our core values

Core company values shape our company culture and impact our business strategy; they help us fulfil our purpose, improve 
team cohesion, and create a sense of commitment in the workplace.

Through a process of surveys and focus groups five core values have been determined: teamwork, respect, accountability, 
courage and trust. The behaviours that will activate these values will be well articulated and 2023 will see education and 
communication about living the Oceana values to ensure that we create an Oceana where people are treated with dignity 
and respect, trusted to contribute courageously to the success of Oceana. The participation in this process was positive 
and overwhelmingly our employees expressed a strong sense of gratitude for having an opportunity to have their say on 
our values.

SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
Sustainability governance ensures effective decision-making, compliance, accountability and transparency in achieving our social and 
environmental goals. The board oversees the process of sustainability and climate change governance integration across the group. We have 
established a strategic sustainability framework to guide group-wide decision-making and action. Within this framework, sustainability-related 
strategies build out our commitments with explicit indicators and targets. Key strategic areas include biodiversity management, environmental 
impact, mitigation, transformation and climate change.

The social, ethics and transformation committee (SETCOM) has been delegated to assist the board in overseeing the sustainability and climate 
change strategy and plays an active role in monitoring the group’s sustainability-related activities and disclosure in terms of legislation, regulation 
and codes of best practice. Through the committee, the Board critically reviews and interrogates sustainability and climate change commitments, 
goals, performance and prospects. SETCOM meets twice a year under the chair of Ms Nomahlubi Simamane.

SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED SKILLS 
AND COMPETENCIES
Directors  are  diverse  in  terms  of  gender,  race  and  professional 
backgrounds, contributing to strong decision-making and ensuring 
that a range of perspectives are brought to bear on matters under 
consideration by the board. They are well-placed to consider the 
significant range of sustainability issues (including climate change 
and biodiversity) pertinent to our operations and value chain.

Coordinated by the Executive: Sustainability and Compliance, various 
sustainability-related professionals across the group keep the board 
abreast of latest developments. Where particular professional skill-sets 
are required, the group contracts advisors and consultants accordingly.

REMUNERATING SUSTAINABILITY 
PERFORMANCE
Our performance-driven approach integrates key sustainability-related 
factors into the incentive system for decision-makers. A limited set 
of key personal indicators (KPIs) for short-term performance focuses 
managers’ attention on the key business and sustainability metrics.

2020

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTIONSUSTAINABILITY-RELATED DOCUMENTATION 
AND DATA MANAGEMENT

Oceana’s sustainability effort is 
informed and guided by ESG-related 
policies that are available on our 
website, oceana.co.za 
These include:
•  Board Diversity 
•  Occupational Health and Safety
•  Environmental Management 
•  Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
•  Human Rights Statement
•  Code of Conduct for Suppliers
•  Business Code of Conduct

 
Effective management systems are in place to mitigate ESG risks 
and respond to sustainability opportunities across the group. These 
require  extensive  documentation  of  policies  and  processes,  as 
well as data management. We monitor and manage the material 
environmental impacts of our operations through our externally audited 
ISO 14001 aligned environmental control system (ECS). All our South 
African and Namibian land-based operations are ISO 14001-aligned.

Our local canning and fishmeal and fish oil businesses achieved 
their FSSC 22000 certification, the food and feed safety standard for 
international Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). Our CCS Epping, 
Midrand, City Deep, Paarden Eiland and Walvis Bay facilities achieved 
FSSC 22000 certification in FY 2022.

To strengthen our monitoring and managing of supply chain risks, 
we engaged with 140 of our top suppliers through a self-assessment 
sustainability questionnaire. This focuses extensively on the policies 
and procedures in place to ensure sound management of sustainability 
issues.

TRANSPARENCY, REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE
We adopt a double materiality approach to our sustainability reporting, 
seeking to present excellent disclosure on sustainability-related issues 
across the integrated reporting suite. A stand-alone Sustainability 
Report has been published since 2012. This year, recognising increasing 
interest and investor expectations in relation to ESG disclosure, we have 
supplemented our reporting suite with a stand-alone ESG Data Book. 

VERIFICATION AND ASSURANCE
The integrity of all reports remains the responsibility of the Board. All 
sustainability-related information is approved by the board’s Social, 
Ethics and Transformation Committee. Accredited service providers 
have reviewed selected non-financial performance metrics. The broad-
based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) scorecard information 
was verified independently by Empowerdex and the greenhouse gas 
emissions by Verify CO2 (including electricity, operational energy 
consumption data and potable water consumption). The risk, health

CRUCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO FOOD SECURITY
The  United  Nations  reported  that  in  2021,  9.8%  of  the  world’s 
population was undernourished. This is 46 million people more than 
in 2020, and 150 million more than in 2019. The aftermath of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, climate extremes, economic 
upheavals and growing inequalities are exacerbating food insecurity 
for many consumers. Food inflation is high in countries across the 
world, affecting those with lowest incomes most severely, and Africa 
is the most hungry continent of all. 

SDG2 includes a commitment to end hunger, achieve food security, 
improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. The 
fisheries sector has a crucial role to play in reaching these goals, by 
providing nutritious and affordable protein. The challenge is to grow 
the provision of affordable protein, while ensuring that it is sustainably 
sourced and produced. This lies at the heart of Oceana’s business and 
sustainability strategy. 

INNOVATING TO SCALE THE PROVISION 
OF HEALTHY, AFFORDABLE FOOD
Oceana’s products play a pivotal role in supporting food security in 
South Africa, Namibia and 45 other countries in Africa. Our business 
model depends on marine resources that are well managed but subject 
to fluctuations, and which require ongoing management to ensure 
their sustainability. Our aim is to provide an uninterrupted supply of 
nutritious, low-cost fish to vast numbers of households. 

We import frozen fish from around the world to our Lucky Star canneries 
in South Africa, to make up the shortfall of supply from southern African 
waters. We now source only 10% of our pilchards from southern Africa, 
importing the rest in frozen from around the world including, Morocco, 
Mauritania and Southeast Asia. 

Compared to other sources of low-cost protein such as chicken and 
processed meats, Lucky Star products are very affordable. We know that 
unemployment and food inflation have made low-income households 
cut back on their protein consumption even further in recent months 
and they are relying on starches, such as rice and maizemeal, to feed 
their families. Families are also stretching the cans of protein that they 
do buy even further, to feed many people. In response, we are working 
hard on innovations that provide more cost-effective sources of protein. 

Faced with relentless supply chain cost increases, our teams sought 
responses that limit increased prices for households. We managed to 
keep our products fairly priced by sourcing fish from wider geographical 
locations, including Morocco, Mauritania, Mexico, the Pacific and 
countries  in  Southeast  Asia;  seeking  consistency  with  shipping 
lines, to ensure consistent rates; engaging actively with retailers and 
wholesalers; conducting substantial analyses of our efficiencies and, 
through creative marketing strategies, seeking to drive up volumes 
sold rather than prices on the shelf. 

In 2019 we launched the Lucky Star corned meat range, in 2021 we 
introduced canned baked beans and chakalaka, and in 2022 we 
launched a new soya product line, at price points below those of 
canned fish. This soya mince and vegetable stew is South Africa’s first 
of its kind in a can. Requiring only brief heating, it is an approved part 
of the Heart and Stroke Foundation eating plan and a low-GI source 
of fibre and protein. 

Lucky Star products are a significant contributor of 
affordable nutrition, with over 

4 million 

meals consumed per day.

In recent years, to support the recovery of the local pilchard 
resource, we have procured most of our pilchard raw 
material internationally, as frozen fish. These continue to 
be processed and canned at our South African operations, 
maintaining job security and efficiencies of scale.

TRACKING THE OPPORTUNITY IN AQUACULTURE
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has predicted 
that aquaculture will play a significant role in food security for Africa. 
Oceana continues to investigate the value of aquaculture as a business 
opportunity, mindful of the fact that the fishmeal we produce is an 
important feedstock for aquaculture species. We shall continue to 
investigate the viability of investing in our own aquaculture operations.

NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS  
OF CANNED FISH 
Lucky Star’s ready-to-eat range of products offer extensive 
health benefits. In addition to being a source of energy, 
canned  fish  is  high  in  Omega-3  fatty  acids,  which 
contribute to brain development and memory function 
and  assist  in  lowering  cholesterol,  benefitting  heart 
health. Canned fish is also rich in iron, iodine and vitamins  
A and B12, and provides selenium, which is regarded as an 
essential mineral needed in small, daily amounts. 

Calcium  in  pilchards,  especially  in  the  soft  bones, 
contributes to muscle and bone development. Tomatoes 
in the sauces provide lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that 
helps fight disease and promotes good health. 

Lucky Star canned fish and soya are excellent natural 
sources of low-GI and high-fibre protein, more easily 
digested than meat protein. Our products are part of the 
South African Heart and Stroke Foundation’s eating plan 
and are endorsed by Diabetes South Africa.

Our business depends on the viability of renewable fishing resources and overall health of the marine environment.  
Our commitment to and promotion of responsible harvesting and biodiversity management is based on:

•  engaging with international suppliers and promoting awareness amongst all our seafaring staff;
•  supporting a multi-stakeholder, ecosystem approach to fisheries management; 
•  participating actively in the Responsible Fisheries Alliance; and
•  ensuring full legal compliance in our highly regulated operating environment.

Oceana has a zero-tolerance approach to illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which undermines fish stocks,  
negatively impacts food security, and ultimately reduces social and economic opportunities.

The majority (85.06%) of our targeted commercial fishing 
rights are on the South African Sustainable Seafood Initiative 
(SASSI) green list.

Pilchard biomass is managed according to sound scientific 
principles and we mitigate our impact by sourcing most of 
our supply internationally as frozen fish. An important source 
area is Morocco, which is at an advanced stage of a fisheries 
improvement project (FIP). The local pilchard resource in 
South Africa remains orange-listed, but has continued a slow, 
steady recovery, resulting in a marginal increase in the total 
allowable catch (TAC). In Namibia, the government placed a 
three-year moratorium on pilchard fishing in 2017. At the time 
of reporting, this moratorium had not been lifted. 

The US Gulf menhaden is one of the few reduction fisheries  
(fish caught for processing into fishmeal and fish oil) in 
the  world  to  be  MSC  certified.  Our  deep-sea  trawling 
hake operation has also retained its MSC chain of custody 
certification. 58% of our wild-caught resource is MSC certified. 

West Coast rock lobster is in the red SASSI category. Since 
the FRAP2015 allocation of fishing rights, our total allowable 
catch has decreased dramatically, by 77%. In anticipation of 
a further dramatic decrease for the 2022/2023 season, we 
decided to close the operational parts of our lobster business. 
Lucky Star Operations merged this facility into their operations 
in October 2022 allowing us to sustain jobs and livelihoods. 

DFFE audit our adherence to allocated fishing rights. 

HOW WE CATCH: BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION
All our fishing practices follow the principle of responsible harvesting. 

Standard  procedures  have  been  developed  to  ensure  that  our 
operations accord with best practice in this area. In addition, we are 
committed to ongoing innovation in support of more efficient and 
sustainable practices. These are increasingly technology enabled, 
such as the device developed to identify and limit bycatch, allowing 
us to quickly release non-target species – such as dolphins, whales 
and sharks – from our nets. 

We  implemented  a  bird  protection  project,  with  Birdlife  Africa 
conducting audits on our hake vessels to make sure we have the 
necessary tori lines on board our vessels.

We maintain systems to entrench compliance, across our various 
business units, with the Marine Living Resources Act 18 of 1998 (MLRA) 
in South Africa and the associated regulations and permit conditions 
in other countries. All incidents of non-compliance are reported and, if 
required, disciplinary action is taken. No incidents of non-compliance 
with the MLRA were reported during this reporting period. 

We have partnered with the Responsible Fisheries Alliance (RFA) to 
deliver training conducted by WWF to our seagoing employees on 
responsible fishing practices, since 2011. The course ensures that 
participants are equipped with the skills needed to implement an 
ecosystem approach to fisheries and understand the significance of 
marine ecosystems in sustainability and long-term socio-economic 
development. 

DATA ON FISH STOCKS: BIODIVERSITY 
RESEARCH
We continue to monitor our resources and related risks to ensure 
the sustainability of fish stocks and our business. To support our 
commitment to sourcing only from fisheries that are considered low 
risk, well managed or undergoing fisheries improvement, we annually 
commission fisheries audit reports on each species that we catch in 
South Africa. Our latest scientific study findings are provided on our 
website www.oceana.co.za. We draw on FAO information to gauge 
the health of the fish stocks of our supply fishers. 

Our horse mackerel mid-water trawler, Desert Diamond, includes two 
scientific observers on board every trip to collect data for research 
and compliance purposes.

PARTNERING FOR POSITIVE IMPACT
We engage regularly with regulators and government departments 
and partner with scientific working groups, industry associations and  
non-governmental organisations, relating to each of the species that 
we harvest, to seek solutions that support small-scale fishers and an 
ecosystem approach to fishing.

Key partners include:

•  Responsible Fisheries Alliance (RFA): Our longstanding partnership with the RFA and WWF provides a platform for 

collaborative research and contributions towards reducing seabird mortalities, improving the management of by-catch, 
improving fisheries management, and addressing threats to the marine environment.

•  South African Deep-Sea Trawling Industry Association (SADSTIA): This partnership has promoted improved management 

of 12 non-target fish species that are caught alongside hake in the deep-sea trawl fishery.

•  South African Mid-Water Trawling Association: This industry association reflects the interests of mid-water trawlers 

and pertains to our activities regarding horse mackerel. 

•  SA Pelagic Fishing Industry Association: This association reflects interests in the pelagic resource sector, and is relevant to 

the SASSI orange listing of the pilchard resource. 

•  West Coast Rock Lobster Association: This industry association reflects the interests of the West Coast Rock Lobster 

resource sector and is of relevance to our activities pertaining to the resource improvement plan.

•  Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission: Daybrook is an active member of the Manhaden Advisory Committee in the Gulf 
States Marine Fisheries Commission, an initiative that drives the conservation, development and full utilisation of the fishery 
resource in the Gulf of Mexico. 

•  Department of the Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE): We are empowered as a sector through the DFFE, 

which has the role of providing leadership and administrative support, an enabling legal regime and effective cooperative 
governance of fishing resources in South Africa. We work closely, often in partnership with the DFFE in many of our 
sustainability efforts.

•  FishSA: A member association with the objective of influencing the policy and legislative environment in so far that it affects 

fishing industry activities, by continuous and professional interaction with all relevant government institutions.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022INTRODUCTIONAFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTClimate change and the marine resource

Climate change features as one of our top three environmental risks at group level, 
and we continually develop our understanding and response to the potential 
effects on our business and value chain. Climate impacts are predicted to cause 
increasing regional variation in the availability and trade of fish products. We have 
observed in our own target fisheries that when environmental conditions change, 
the resource moves to an area it finds more hospitable. The anchovy species tend 
to favour a cooler system, while sardines/pilchards prefer a warmer system. Extreme 
weather events and sea-level rise are also anticipated to affect fisheries-related 
infrastructure such as ports and fleets. The potential increase in intensity and 
frequency of ocean storms poses a particular risk for our Daybrook operations in 
the Gulf of Mexico.

FROM CLIMATE RISK TO CLIMATE SCENARIOS 
Oceana’s 2014 climate change risk and vulnerability assessment 
provided a basic scenario analysis that informed our strategic planning 
and investment decisions. In our annual CDP submissions, we analyse 
climate-related risks and opportunities over the short, medium and 
long-term, along with material impacts. (The 2022 submission is based 
on 2021 financial year information). We now seek greater alignment 
with the expectations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
disclosures (TCFD).

Changing ocean and weather conditions are difficult to predict, and the 
group adopts a precautionary approach to manage these influences. 
We commission annual fisheries audit reports on each species that we 
catch in South Africa. Our latest scientific study findings are provided 
on our website, www.oceana.co.za. We include climate change 
impacts within our environmental risk register, participate in initiatives 
aimed at better understanding resource availability and distribution, 
and implement climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Our 
diversification strategy enables us to mitigate risk through geographic 
and species diversity. Our investments along different coastlines and 
in different geographies ensure variability in climate-related impacts.

Scientific research and operational management procedures provide 
some safeguards against an uncertain future. Management responses 
to ecosystem changes are crucial to minimise the threats and maximise 
the opportunities emerging from climate change. Climate change 
adaptation and mitigation planning is high on the South African 
Government agenda and Oceana continues to engage with the DFFE on 
resource status research and on the Climate Smart Strategic Framework 
for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

LOOKING AHEAD
In 2023, we will undertake a baseline resource analysis and long-term 
assessment of our target species. This will cover all the main species 
we catch – pilchards worldwide, other target species in South Africa 
and Namibia, and the US menhaden. Scoped to include the potential 
impacts of climate change, this work will provide a valuable input into 
our longer term scenario thinking.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022PARTNERING FOR  INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENTENERGY SECURITY AND  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENTOCEANA PEOPLE: ENABLING ACTIONRESPONDING TO  COMMUNITY NEEDS APPENDICESEnsuring the highest standard of food 
and feed safety and quality

Food safety is a top ten business risk 
for Oceana. We remain committed to 
demonstrating leadership in ensuring 
the safety and integrity of all our 
products. In 2022, there were once 
again no product recalls and we are 
confident that the safety and quality 
of our foods remains under control.
BEST PRACTICE APPROACH
Our feed and food safety systems extend across the full supply chain 
– from procurement of raw materials to production and procurement 
of final products, to sales and distribution and to consumption (ocean 
to plate). These are founded on internationally recognised technical 
regulations and standards aimed at protecting public health. We 
meet the requirements of these technical regulations and standards 
administered in South Africa, Namibia and the US, as well as standards 
and principles of Codex Alimentarius and the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO). In relation to fishmeal and fish oil products, 
we use the World Organisation for Animal Health principles as the 
basis for animal health systems.

ACCREDITATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
We comply with several global compliance and food safety standards 
and regulations. This year, our local canning businesses achieved 
their FSSC 22 000 certification, the food and feed safety standard for 
the international Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI). Our CCS Epping 
facilities achieved FSSC 22 000 certification in FY 2021, with CCS Paarden 
Eiland, CCS Midrand and CCS City Deep. 

We maintain the following accreditations and quality assurance 
processes:

•  Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points principles (HACCP) 

certification across all our land-based facilities and vessels

•  Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) accreditation for our hake 

operations

•  MSC accreditation for Gulf menhaden resource, USA
•  MarinTrust  (formerly  IFFO-RS)  accreditation  for  100%  of 

fishmeal and fish oil operations

•  All our international canned products and ingredients suppliers 

are certified to a GFSI-recognised standard

•  All canned fish and fishery products sold by the group are 
verified as safe to eat by the National Regulator for Compulsory 
Specification (NRCS) in South Africa, the FDA in the USA and 
the Namibia Standards Institute in Namibia.

We ensure that the necessary processes are in place to ensure the 
safety of all our new canned food products, and that they meet the 
same quality requirements achieved by our canned fish products. 

OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Food and feed safety is everybody’s responsibility at Oceana, from the 
CEO to the factory staff; a food and feed safety culture is continually 
promoted through awareness and annual food safety training. Each 
division has dedicated food and feed safety and quality managers 
who  ensure  compliance  to  standard  operating  procedures  and 
drive continual improvements, and highly trained quality assurance 
technologists.  

2828

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022INTRODUCTIONAFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTAUDITING AND CONTROL 
In implementing our risk-based management approach to ensuring 
the safety and integrity of all products, we emphasise proactive steps 
and preventive controls to mitigate risks. We conduct regular audits 
(internal and external), inspections, surveillance and examinations of 
product designs, products, services, processes and processing plants, 
to determine their conformity with specific or general requirements. We 
uphold a zero-tolerance stance to any deviation from the quality and 
safety specifications in place for our own operations as well as those 
of our suppliers. We focus on allergens as well as biological, chemical, 
physical and regulatory hazards that can occur if not controlled. 

When we develop new products, including the canned vegetables 
introduced in 2021 and the soya products made available this year, we 
ensure that the necessary quality and safety specifications, processes 
and procedures are in place to guarantee the highest standards. We 
are confident that all our new products comply with these standards. 

Auditing programmes are aligned with documented food safety 
systems. We have an annual documented audit and inspection activity 
programme, devised on a risk- and science-based approach, which 
took place this year according to schedule. Audit findings are classified 
as low, medium or critical. We implement corrective actions where 
necessary and maintain a focus on preventative measures to mitigate 
risks. We strive to continually improve our audit scores and progress 
in line with international food safety management systems. 

We maintain a rigorous assurance programme in our canned fish, oil 
and fishmeal divisions, where we manage a broad range of food and 
feed quality and safety risks. Maintaining consistency and quality 
throughout our canning supply chain is crucial, particularly given 
the considerable increase in geographical areas and suppliers from 
which we source our raw materials. With this understanding, we 
audit each new processor every three to four months, and third-
party inspections are conducted on every supplier batch produced. 
All ingredient suppliers are audited annually or every two years, 
depending on the level of risk. 

We audit our can suppliers locally and internationally. Following the 
easing of many international restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic, 
we reintroduced physical audits in Thailand from August 2022. Virtual 
audits will continue for our Chinese canner and key ingredient suppliers 
until there are no longer restrictions in place for visiting China. This 
year, we sent food safety related questionnaires to key suppliers, 
assessing their feedback for potential risks. No additional risk areas 
were identified from this process.

SKILLS DEVELOPMENT, OUTREACH 
AND COLLABORATION
Our teams of highly trained and experienced food and feed safety 
technologists work closely with our suppliers, providing support and 
guidance where needed, with an emphasis always on preventative 
measures. We continue to focus on guiding suppliers on how to conduct 
audits to facilitate robust virtual auditing with our teams. We invest in 
developing the capacity and experience of newly appointed qualified 
food technologists. We provide internal refresher food and feed safety 
training annually and external training every two to three years. 

Lucky Star’s canned fish customer service includes a helpline and 
personal assistance to respond to and follow up on all product 
enquiries, concerns or complaints. All material customer enquiries 
and complaints are investigated and addressed.

Cooperation with suppliers has remained strong. We continue to 
participate in collaborative public-private partnerships aimed at 
improving public health outcomes, enhancing food safety education, 
building food safety, public health and animal health capacity.

PROMOTING TRANSFORMATION IN 
SOUTH AFRICA
Over the past five years, Oceana has consistently been rated as 
one of the most empowered JSE-listed companies (Empowerdex 
Most Empowered Companies ranking). Our Transformation Forum 
committee, comprised of leadership across the SA business divisions, 
has supported us in maintaining a Level 1 B-BBEE rating for the third 
year in a row this year, achieving a score of 105.10 out of 109 this year. 

We continue to closely monitor legislative and policy developments, 
and to engage with regulators, to ensure that our long-standing 
empowerment activities have been clearly communicated and that 
our ongoing transformation activities are sufficiently aligned with 
government’s expectations. 

We keep our transformation strategy active through conducting gap 
analyses on all B-BBEE elements per division; setting targets with 
each divisional MD; refresher training across the Group; quarterly 
Transformation Forums to report and track progress, and quarterly 
audits on B-BBEE elements. Our Group Transformation and Localisation 
Manager works closely with employees involved in reporting on B-BBEE 
within the business. 

In 2022 we achieved the maximum possible BBBEE points at both 
board and member levels, appointed a black executive director and 
continued to make progress in transforming our in our senior, middle 
and junior management ranks.

PROMOTING LOCALISATION IN NAMIBIA 
Oceana operates through three companies in Namibia with a combined 
fixed assets value of N$763 million and more than 1 000 employees, 
including indirect jobs:

Erongo Marine Enterprises operates in partnership with local horse 
mackerel  rights  holders  (previously  disadvantaged  Namibians), 
including  the  broad-based  economic  empowerment  scheme 
Erongo Harambee Workers Trust. We continue to contribute to job 
security and empowerment through this trust, delivering dividends to 
participants through the rights-holding company Arechanab Fishing 
and Development. 

Commercial Cold Storage (CCS), our Namibian cold storage business, 
was sold this year. Its empowerment agreement with Erongo, whereby 
permanent employees own a 31% shareholding in CCS through the 
Trust, has been sustained. 

Etosha Fishing Corporation is a majority Namibian shareholding, 
with Oceana owning 44.9%. 

Our  Namibian  operations  place  an  emphasis  on  workforce 
indigenisation, enabling broad-based equity and shared prosperity. 
We also invest in strategic local enterprise development initiatives.

Significant developments in the policy environment include the June 
2022 launch of Namibia’s National Plan of Action for Small-Scale 
and the establishment of the Namibia Investment Promotion and 
Development Board, which has a mandate to promote, attract, and 
retain both domestic and foreign investments. We anticipate further 
constructive engagement on the contents of the Draft Namibian 
Equitable Economic Empowerment Framework. 

With the longstanding pilchard moratorium still in place in Namibia, 
Oceana continues to import frozen pilchards to keep the Etosha 
cannery operational and to sustain approximately 600 jobs. 

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE DTI’S B-BBEE 
SCORECARD 
An overview of our performance against the full B-BBEE scorecard is 
provided on our website www.oceana.co.za. 

Ownership:  We  have  maintained  our  black-owned  and  black-
controlled shareholding with two main, empowerment shareholders: 
Brimstone Investment Corporation and the Saam-Sonke Trust. We had 
a combined black ownership holding of 83.65%. 

Management control: We achieved the maximum points at both 
board and member level and continued to make reasonable progress 
in transforming our senior, middle and junior managerial ranks. We’ve 
focused our recruitment policy more actively on B-BBEE candidates, 
seeking to attract African black males and females and retaining our 
current black talent. 

Skills  development:  We  continue  to  invest  in  developing  our 
employees against the backdrop of the scarcity of skills in our sector, 
investing R36 million in training black employees this year. Currently, 
5.3% of our workforce is on a learnership, apprenticeship and internship

SUPPORTING EMPOWERMENT BY TRAINING 
SMALL-SCALE FISHERS
A significant empowerment opportunity has been created by the South 
African Government’s small-scale fisheries policy which recognises 
fishermen and women through the allocation of fishing quotas. This 
has awarded 15-year small-scale fishing rights to over 10 500 fishers 
organised in 110 co-operatives nationwide. Through this policy, small-
scale fishers can play an increasingly important role in addressing 
food security and reducing unemployment in South Africa. Oceana 
continues to work with government and other stakeholders to support 
government’s efforts to develop small-scale fishers. 

Our principal contribution is Co-operative Sense – an extensive skills 
development programme, in participants’ preferred language (Zulu, 
Xhosa, English, Afrikaans). The programme is provided through the 
Oceana Maritime Academy. The project was conducted in collaboration 
with the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE), 
NSRI, Dyna Training and a leading South African banking institution. 
The training included co-operative business skills and the track and 
traceability of sustainable fishing practices. 

In 2021, we trained 295 small-scale fishers and in 2022 we trained 541. 
Average attendance levels at our programmes are high (89% in 2022) 
and we have reached almost all the small-scale fisher cooperatives 
across the country, in many cases in the most rural and remote areas 
in KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape. We trained 
cooperatives in KwaZulu-Natal shortly after the civil unrest in July, 
bringing small-scale fishers from different communities together, 
which resulted in a strong sense of social cohesion in the classroom.

SHARE OWNERSHIP SCHEMES
The group is committed to empowering our employees and SMMEs 
in  our  sector  through  innovative  shared  ownership  schemes.  
The Oceana Empowerment Trust (the Trust), was the largest 100% 
black-owned fishing entity in South Africa in terms of ownership value, 
with ownership extending to more than 2 400 employees. The Trust’s 
full value to beneficiaries since its establishment in 2006 totalled just 
less than R1 billion. This Trust vested in January 2021. 

Building  on  this  success,  Oceana  launched  its  second,  broader 
employee share scheme, the Oceana Saam-Sonke Trust, in September 
2021. This Trust is driving ownership by the wider workforce: all South 
African citizens working permanently for Oceana in South Africa qualify 
as beneficiaries, irrespective of race, job grade or years of service. 

A total of 7.8 million shares were 
issued to the Saam-Sonke Trust, 
representing 6% of issued Oceana 
shares, with a transaction value 
of R530 million. The shares are 
allocated equitably among an 
estimated 2 263 beneficiaries.

We also launched the Oceana Stakeholders Empowerment Trust which 
was aimed at facilitating beneficial participation in the ownership of 
the group by eligible SMMEs. 

Both Saam-Sonke and the Stakeholders Empowerment Trust will be in 
place for 10 years, with a third equally vesting in years eight, nine and 10.

PREFERENTIAL PROCUREMENT
We are committed to fostering a procurement system that is fair, transparent, equitable, competitive, ethical and cost-effective. At the same 
time, we continue to maintain a diverse supplier base and build relationships with suppliers in and around the geographical locations in which 
we operate. 

Preferential procurement processes, including setting local sourcing targets, are integrated into the business activities across the group. In South 
Africa, we focus on aligning with B-BBEE Act objectives, procuring our goods and services from suppliers with favourable B-BBEE credentials. 
Preferential procurement is a KPI at group level and divisional level.

Of our total measured procurement spend, 81.44% was with B-BBEE compliant suppliers (2021: 109.87%), proactively ensuring that procurement 
is redirected towards SMMEs, black-owned, black-female-owned and black-designated group suppliers. 

Over the past 11 years we have spent R3.6 billion with black female-owned businesses. 

We continue to engage with B-BBEE non-compliant suppliers, promoting and supporting their efforts towards greater compliance.

Our main contribution to enterprise development continues to be 
through joint ventures with smaller fishing companies and suppliers. 
This constitutes a pillar of our efforts to support smaller fishers, as 
we work with them to develop and sustain a viable fishing industry. 

In 2022, we leveraged our fishing and processing assets to establish 
long-term partnerships with SMMEs and new entrants to the fishing 
sector. We are investigating a group-wide Enterprise and Supplier 
development Programme to promote greater impact.

Our supplier development initiatives in South Africa include the 
provision of loans, grants, advances and preferential payment terms to 
black-owned enterprises. The Codes require beneficiaries to be either 
an exempt micro-enterprise (EME) or a qualifying small enterprise 
(QSE) that is 51% or more black-owned. 

We have established targeted enterprise and supplier development 
(ESD) programmes at certain operations that are developing the 
capacity of existing or potential suppliers, and young entrepreneurs 
in local communities.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTIONEnhancing ESG practices across our 
supply chain

We have a diverse base of suppliers from which we procure goods 
and services. Our initiatives in building responsible supply chains are 
driven by our values and supported by our Supplier Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics. 

All our suppliers are required to sign and adhere to our Supplier 
Code of Conduct, which is aligned with the UN Global Compact and 
provides high level guidance on our expectations. This outlines our 
requirements across areas including safety and health, environmental 
stewardship, governance and ethics, our communities, human rights, 
procurement, and transformation. There were no incidents of irregular 
business recorded this year. 

Our group procurement forum, involving representatives from all 
business divisions, convenes at least monthly to discuss supply chain 
issues, including supply chain risks. This central procurement team 
works closely with our sustainability and compliance forums.

SUPPLIER SELF-ASSESSMENT
To strengthen our monitoring and managing of supply chain risks, 
in 2022 we engaged with 140 of our top suppliers (from a spend 
perspective) through a self-assessment sustainability questionnaire. 
This  was  an  extension  to  a  pilot  project  initiated  in  2021,  and 
investigated issues including the reduction of carbon emissions, 
water and energy conservation, waste management and human 
rights. Based on a response rate of 48%, a number of findings were 
gathered that will be used to establish a benchmark of our suppliers’ 
ESG risks and to inform Oceana’s future sustainability engagement 
focus within the supply chain.

PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLIER 
RESPONDENTS THAT SELF-ASSESSED 
THEIR ORGANISATION AS HAVING: 

Code of conduct: 77%
Health and safety policy: 91%

Environmental policy (energy, water use, 
air emissions, chemicals, waste): 62%
Social policies, including human rights: 73%

Further  findings  indicated  that  50%  of  respondents  have  an 
Environmental Management System (EMS), of which 14% have an 
ISO 14001 certified EMS, 27% implement an ISO 14001-aligned EMS 
and the remaining 9% have an EMS which is not ISO 14001-aligned.

audits to monitor levels of compliance. All our South African and 
Namibian land-based operations, are ISO 14001-aligned, and in 2022 we 
began the process of achieving alignment for our US facility.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Our  environmental  policy,  available  on  our  website,  has  been 
embedded into our operations and we are now increasingly focused 
on applying its principles throughout our supply chain. The policy 
outlines our commitment to effective management of resources, 
reduced impacts on the environment and host communities, and 
compliance to legal requirements. 

Key functional and divisional senior members contribute actively to 
environmental strategy development and assess progress on energy 
and water conservation projects, waste management, and our KPIs 
on climate change and energy management. This process has been 
formalised into a Sustainability Forum which meets on a quarterly 
basis to encourage and promote shared learning and collective impact 
across the group. 

Beyond our operations, we seek to extend environmental awareness 
and conservation initiatives into our work with host communities.

COMPLIANCE AND AUDITS 
We continue to drive improvements through our ISO 14001-aligned 
environmental control system (ECS), conducting internal and external 

This year, we undertook 13 external environmental compliance audits, 
covering all our US, South African and Namibian land-operations, 
to  ensure  compliance  with  the  relevant  legislation  and  permit 
requirements, as well as with our own system requirements. 

Compliance targets for 2022 required an overall average score of 90% 
and a minimum score of 65% for each element in the audit.

•  Land-based facilities: Eight Oceana land-based facilities were 

externally audited. All divisions met the minimum target for 
the overall score as well as the individual element minimum 
requirement for each of the components. The group achieved a 
score of 99% (2021: 98%). 

•  Sea-based vessels: One small pelagic vessel, two hake vessels 

and one-horse mackerel vessel were audited. The average score 
was 100% (2021: 99%).

This reporting period we received a pre-notice of non-compliance 
received in terms of LSO’s coastal water discharge permit exceedances, 
that have subsequently been resolved with an approved improvement 
plan in place.

Zero penalties were issued during this reporting period.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Climate change is a defining challenge of our time. Our commitment to 
climate action is underpinned by our work to reduce greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions through progressive decarbonisation, while enhancing 
energy resilience across our operations. In line with the UNFCC Paris 
Agreement’s commitments and our sustainability strategy, we are 
pursuing targets of 50% absolute reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 
(on a 2019 baseline), independence from third-party non-renewable 
electricity supply by 2040, and carbon neutrality (Net Zero) across 
our operations by 2050. 

Oceana’s scope 1 and 2 emission intensity reduction targets are aligned 
with a science-based approach though not formally validated by the 
Science Based Targets initiative. 

Our Group Energy Resilience Team leads our efforts in support of 
energy security and decarbonising our energy supply. Our climate 
response has been spurred by the increasing costs of electricity and 
the risk of energy insecurity. Fuel and energy costs comprise a large 
percentage of Oceana’s spend, and our energy and water efficiency 
measures have already resulted in significant operational savings over 
the years. To incentivise the attainment of our targets, KPIs for emission 
and energy reductions are incorporated into divisional management 
and executive reward programmes.

IMPLEMENTATION PATHWAYS

A range of energy efficiency 
measures on both vessel and 
land operations have already 
contributed to reduced scope 1 and 
scope 2 emissions. These included 
retrofitting new trawler doors on 
vessels, solar PV and lighting at  
our CCS facilities.

Beyond efficiency, the strategy focuses primarily on renewable energy, 
converting our freon-powered freezing facilities to other suitable 
refrigerant gas, and further gas-related interventions. Each division has 
been tasked with implementing a long-term energy management plan. 
Proposals are adjusted according to evolving viability and technology 
developments. 

In the United States, our operations rely on energy generated with 
liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG),  emitting  significantly  lower  carbon 
emissions compared to South Africa’s coal and diesel generated power. 
Back-up generators are still required to mitigate against loadshedding 
at our South African operations. Accordingly, South Africa remains our 
primary focus for alternative electricity, gas and fuel projects. 

RESPONDING TO CLIMATE RISK 
Environmental  pressures  influence  both  the  production  and 
consumption of our products. Climate change features as one of 
our top three environmental risks at group level, and we continually 
develop our understanding and response to the potential effects on 
our business and value chain. 

Climate impacts are predicted to cause significant regional variation 
in the availability and trade of fish products. We have observed in our 
own target fisheries that when environmental conditions change, the 
resource moves to an area it finds more comfortable. The anchovy 
species tend to favour a cooler system, while sardines/pilchards 
prefer a warmer system. Extreme weather events and sea-level rise 
are anticipated to affect fisheries-related infrastructure such as ports 
and fleets. The potential increase in intensity and frequency of ocean 
storms poses a particular risk for our Daybrook operations in the Gulf 
of Mexico.

Freon conversion to alternative 
refrigeration gases: 
A major reduction in our emissions will be 
achieved through the conversion of freon-
based freezing facilities on our seven large 
BCP hake vessels, which currently account 
for 22% of our global direct footprint, to 
either a carbon-neutral ammonia-based 
or other suitable gas systems. This high 
capital investment project will ensure 
compliance with international legislation 
and will be implemented over the next 
four years starting on our deep-sea 
vessel Beatrice, then on all our vessels. 
Freon is being phased out in the industry 

after 2025. 

Coal to natural gas: 
Oceana uses coal to generate steam at its 
canneries, which contributes significantly 
to our overall carbon tax liability. 
Feasibility studies are underway to shift 
from using coal for boiler fuel to more 
sustainable, lower-emissions sources, 
notably liquefied natural gas (LNG) and 
biomass. We are closely monitoring 
local developments in this area. Our 
FY22 Carbon tax liability equated to 
R1.72 million. 

Hydrogen:  
We are investigating the viability of using 
hydrogen as a green fuel replacement.

RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
We are currently focused on solar photovoltaic (PV) 
projects for facilities where we consume the most electricity. 

•  Our CCS operations are highly reliant on electricity supply to meet 

cold storage requirements. A solar PV roof-top project providing 
480kWh to our Paarden Eiland cold store became operational in 
August 2021. 

•  We have completed the environmental impact assessment 

application and commenced with the land zoning application 
requirements for a 10MW solar facility on the West Coast to supply 
electricity to our two canneries and fishmeal plants. This initiative is 
due to be completed in 2023 and is expected to supply a significant 
portion of the electricity requirements of our two canneries and 
fishmeal plants. This project is still subject to regulatory approvals.

CARBON TAX COMPLIANCE
Our South African operations comply with requirements of 
national GHG emission-reporting regulations and the Carbon 
Tax Act. Based on current requirements, two Oceana statutory 
entities (Amawandle Pelagic and Lucky Star) are liable to 
pay carbon tax for direct CO2 emissions from the combustion 

of coal and other fossil fuels, for the second phase of the 
scheme (1 June 2019 to 31 December 2022). Oceana filed its 
second carbon tax submission in July 2022 as required − the 
tax is payable for the previous financial year − amounting to 
R1.72 million.

MANAGEMENT APPROACH
Oceana maintains a strong focus on minimising its water footprint, 
particularly  in  South  Africa,  where  many  regions  are  already 
experiencing water scarcity and government estimates that business-
as-usual demand will outstrip supply by 2025. Our capital investments 
in water reuse and reduction initiatives over recent years have resulted 
in a 30%-40% absolute reduction in the South African demand on 
municipal water supply, against a 2018 baseline.

We have significantly reduced our reliance on municipal potable 
water through two desalination plants, established at St Helena Bay 
and Laaiplek in 2018, which enable us to produce up to 1.4 million 
litres of potable water daily. We operate two reverse osmosis plants 
at our cold store facilities in Cape Town, and a borehole/well system, 
to cater for our facilities in the city. We extract proteins and solids 
from our fish processing water (stick water) to enable its reuse. We 
also recover condensate and steam in the fishmeal plants which is 
reused in our boilers.

The Oceana Head Office in the Foreshore (Cape Town) uses treated 
grey water for all sanitation purposes.

To drive water-use efficiency and water quality improvements and 
to meet water licensing requirements, we installed a dissolved air 
flotation plant in 2021 at Amawandle Pelagic to treat our effluent 
water. An analysis of water samples has demonstrated the positive 
impact. This year, we also upgraded the air flotation plant at Laaiplek, 
with promising results. 

In operations CCS Walvis Bay, we are planning a desalination plant to 
provide fresh water for our condensers. We have submitted plans to 
the authorities and plan to install the plant in 2023. 

We have improved our water measuring and monitoring systems at 
certain operations to pick up water leaks and excess use. We initiated 
a pilot water balance project in 2021 in St Helena Bay. This is being 
rolled out progressively across the group. 

As part of our collective effort to manage water resources with the Berg 
River catchment, we participate in the St Helena Bay Water Quality 
Trust. Its aim is to mitigate and manage the water quality of the West 
Coast Peninsula and estuaries.

SUSTAINED PERFORMANCE
The group’s total municipal potable water consumption increased by 20% year-on-year, to 369 666kℓ (2021: 302 289kℓ). Usage per unit of activity 
increased to 0.46kℓ per ton of product produced or stored and handled, compared to 0.41kℓ in FY2021. The increase in potable water consumption 
is as a direct result of increased production.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTIONManaging effluent and 
atmospheric emissions

We strive to minimise the negative impact of our operations on air 
quality and to keep our atmospheric emissions within legal limits. 
In addition to greenhouse gases (GHGs), we monitor and manage 
the emission of hydrogen sulphide, as per the requirements of our 
atmospheric emission licence (AEL). 

We operate our facilities in compliance with the requirements of 
the AEL in place at the Lucky Star St Helena Bay facility and at the 
Amawandle facility in Laaiplek. 

At our St Helena Bay facility, the fishmeal plant, boiler air and other 
stack emissions are independently measured. At both sites, our 
monitoring and audits have confirmed that levels of emissions are well 
within limits for both sites. Last year, we increased the stack height from 
17 to 21 metres, which has resulted in reduced atmospheric emissions.

Ensuring compliance with tightened effluent parameters requires some 
redesign. We are investing R4 million in an effluent plant we will trial 
at Laaiplek and St Helena Bay. 

In addition to ensuring compliance with atmospheric emissions 

regulations, we focus on mitigating the social impacts of odour 
emissions.  We hold bi-annual air quality management meetings 
with the communities within which our fishmeal plants are located to 
engage on matters of common concern and communicate pertinent 
environmental management information. We report any complaints 
received to authorities and investigate and respond to each case. 

This year, we strengthened our consultation with local communities, 
municipalities and other forums in response to stakeholder concerns 
related to odour and air emissions from fishmeal plants on the West 
Coast of South Africa. 

There were no incidents of pollution, or oil spills, recorded by any of 
our vessels this year.

We strive to reduce and manage our waste streams to minimise effects 
on human health and the environment. We are informed by the global 
movement towards a more circular economy and believe it is possible 
to eliminate or repurpose ‘waste’ into new resources.

CIRCULAR SYSTEMS
We have maintained our focus on preventing food waste. We continued 
to achieve our target of ensuring that zero food waste fit for human 
or animal consumption, including fish off-cuts from canneries and 
the Desert Diamond, was sent to landfills. Our fishmeal processing 
facilities provide an excellent circular opportunity and 100% of this 
waste stream is now directed to these facilities.  

Our teams continue to explore circular opportunities, in some cases 
through the reclassification of certain waste streams. For example, 
we have submitted an application to environmental affairs to exclude 
the LSO coal ash as a waste stream from the definition of waste, 
which would enable us to direct it towards the local construction 
industry, as an input material in their processes. We currently generate 
approximately 6 779 tons of coal ash that is landfilled. Should this 
waste be reclassified and reused, the percentage of waste directed 
to the landfill will reduce to 23%.

WASTE SEPARATION AND RECYCLING
Oceana generated 21 864 tons of waste in 2022, of which 30% was 
recycled and 70% sent to landfill. We have set a target for 2023 to 
reduce the volume of waste landfilled by 2.5% annually. 

We have improved the separation of waste streams at our sites, with 
an emphasis on our vessels. This is enabling us to better measure the 
waste produced and recycled, providing a more informed baseline 
from which to measure our progress. 

All waste destined for landfill is suitably disposed of at a licensed 
landfill site. 

HAZARDOUS WASTE
Where recycling is not possible, hazardous waste is disposed of at a 
suitably licensed landfill, and a certificate of safe disposal kept on file. 
In total, 5 900 tons of hazardous waste, consisting of coal ash, bilge 
water and oil sludge was generated during this reporting period and 
suitably disposed of, with certificates of safe disposal kept on file. 

VESSEL-BASED WASTE
We have continued to improve our waste management systems 
onboard vessels. In driving responsible waste disposal practices, 
all plastic water bottles used on Desert Diamond are collected, 
washed and stripped of labelling by crew onboard, and collected for 
recycling. Proceeds have been used to host quarterly beach clean-ups. 
To incentivise the scheme, in future all proceeds will be reinvested in 
initiatives that directly benefit the crew collecting the waste.

SUSTAINED PERFORMANCE
The aim is to divert increasing amounts of waste from landfills, and for 
recycling and other circular economy activities to gain momentum.

In promoting the waste management 
hierarchy ‘avoid, reduce, recover, reuse 
and recycle’, BCP repairs damaged vessel 
nets to extend their life. Once beyond 
repair they are donated for reuse and 
repurposing in enterprising causes that 
benefit local communities. Since 2015, 
we have donated our worn-out vessel 
nets to local schools for use as soccer 
nets. Since April 2021, we have been 
partnering with students at the University 
of Cape Town, donating our disused nets 
to them for use in making bags for sale.

CLEANING OUR BEACHES ON WORLD OCEANS DAY 
To commemorate World Oceans Day on 8 June 2022, Oceana people rolled up their sleeves, put on their gloves and set to work 
cleaning up Milnerton Beach. Refuse collected largely comprised ropes, nets, plastic drink bottles, beer bottles, diapers, fast food 
packaging, bottle tops, cigarette ends and rags.

PROTECTING THE AFRICAN PENGUIN
Oceana is concerned about the dramatic decrease in numbers of African penguins, endemic to South Africa and Namibia, 
and is committed to abiding by fishing limitations set up DFFE and the recommendations of an international scientific 
review panel.

The DFFE has declared certain areas around the major penguin colonies as closed to commercial fishing for anchovy and 
sardine, following extensive negotiation with seabird conservation groups and pelagic fishing industry representatives. 
The interim fishing limitations are in effect from 1 September 2022, until 14 April 2023, and include defined areas around 
Dassen Island, Robben Island, Stony Point, Dyer Island, St Croix Island and Bird Island. The department said the temporary 
closures would allow for the scientific review to be set up, and its findings would provide guidance on the value of fishing 
limitations for the penguin colonies’ revival. 

Both conservation groups and the fishing industry have committed to abide by the review panel’s findings.

The sardine stock in South Africa continues to be at historically low levels. Other factors negatively affecting penguin colonies 
include shipping traffic and the associated noise and vibrations, pollution and degrading of suitable nesting habits through 
historic removal of guano, and coastal commercial and residential developments.

Job security and being a leading employer in our industry remain 
moral imperatives for Oceana in our South African, US and Namibian 
operations. Despite the challenges of Covid-19 pandemic and the 
continued economic pressures in its wake, Oceana has sustained 
its levels of employment over the last three years. This has been 
facilitated by our frozen fish import strategy, which enables us to 
continue to provide regular work scheduling and thus a stable income 
for our seasonal employees in Namibia and South Africa, where high 
unemployment remains a serious challenge. 

Keeping operations active even when they are no longer significant 
contributors to our bottom line, also increasing our Group’s resilience. 
By considering jobs and operations from a longer-term perspective, it 
becomes possible to increase redundancy and maintain our options 
in the face of uncertainty. 

This mindset is particularly important in an industry that is affected 
by quota limits, as there are times when certain facilities face reduced 
utilisation. In such instances, we attempt to redeploy employees 
across the business wherever feasible. In 2022, we had to restructure 
the operations of our West Coast Rock Lobster business and close our 
facilities on the West Coast due to dramatic decreases in our quotas, the 
rising cost of operations, rising inflation and the economic downturn. 

In this instance, to maintain job opportunities for land-based staff, LSO 
extended their operations to include the lobster factory, merging it 
into their St Helena operations. This process commenced in October 
2022. We consulted with 34 impacted employees as is required by 
legislation, as well as engaging with union stakeholders. This ensured 
that our employees could retain their jobs while remaining in their 
communities, as no relocation was required. We were able to meet our 
commitment that the closure would have no impact on job security. 
Our focus now is on growth, with job security remaining an important 
driver of this effort. At the time of writing 12 have refused the alternative 
employment offered by LSO and we will finalise the process with the 
support of the CCMA.

Unfortunately, over this reporting period, one person lost their life in a 
workplace incident and we have conveyed our heartfelt condolences 
to the families. This incident was fully investigated, and no negligence 
was found on the part of Desert Diamond Fishing (DDF). In line with 
our commitment to continuous improvement and our commitment 
to zero harm in the workplace, measures of further improvement have 
been implemented.

Maintaining safe, healthy work conditions is a prerequisite for our 
commitment to zero harm. The managing directors of all operating 
divisions  are  responsible  for  ensuring  full  compliance  with  the 
relevant occupational health and safety legislation, and that the 
required structures are in place. We implement campaigns across 
our operations aimed at promoting an active safety culture that goes 
beyond compliance.

Ongoing activities to mitigate the health and safety risks inherent to our 
land- and sea-based activities include safety monitoring, training and 
enforcement programmes, provision of relevant personal protective 
equipment and access to medical facilities, and periodic safety audits 
on all sites and vessels. 

We implement campaigns across our operations aimed at promoting 
an active safety culture that goes beyond compliance. A further step 
forward was taken at our Daybrook operation, where machine upgrades 
for presses and dryers have reduced levels of human intervention in 
processing activities.

HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENTS 
AND AUDITS
We strive for continuous improvement in our management of health 
and safety risks. 

Land-based and vessel-specific health and safety risk assessments 
form the foundation of our health and safety management system. 
Marsh Risk Consulting audits the health and safety risk assessment 
and associated management system annually. 

Elements covered in the risk audits include:

•  Safety governance 
•  Fire defence
•  Security management
•  Occupational health and safety
•  Machine and equipment safety
•  Life-saving appliances and emergency drills (vessel-specific)
•  Emergency planning
•  Electrical safety.

See results in the ESG Data Book that follows for more information. 

Compliance with external health and safety audits was 98% for all 
land-based facilities (2021: 99%) and 94% for all vessels (2021: 98%). 
In-house audits on our land-based facilities provide another level of 
assurance. 

See results in the ESG Data Book for more information. Detailed audit 
results are provided on our website at www.oceana.co.za.

INCIDENT REPORTING AND INVESTIGATIONS
All incidents are reported via our online platform with consistent 
classification and risk rating used across the Group. This tool – which 
includes a dashboard to monitor performance across all operations – 
promotes oversight, accountability and responsibility for the reporting 
of significant incidents, as well as investigating and addressing causes, 
and sharing learnings. All serious, critical, and catastrophic incidents 
are investigated, and actions implemented and shared with the broader 
Group as part of our commitment to continual improvement.

EMPLOYEE AND CONTRACTOR TRAINING 
Our learning and development department facilitates annual employee 
training according to the OHSA and SAMSA requirements. The training 
conducted on-site or at the Maritime Academy incorporates statutory 
safety and annual induction occupational health and safety training 
for all staff. 

Our health and safety training programmes include GMP, HACCP, 
implementation of the Occupational Health and Safety (OHASA) Act 
85 of 1993, firefighting (all levels), first aid (all levels), safety handling 
of winches and lifting, competence in survival craft, pre-sea training, 
safety officer training, personal safety training and personal survival 
techniques. We provide periodic refresher training. 

SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENTS AND 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Contractors receive an induction covering health and safety and 
environmental management elements before accessing our facilities 
and vessels. Where required, safe work procedures and permits are 
issued before work commences.

In the early hours of Sunday morning a Purse Seiner capsized 
off Cape Point. Luckily for the 12-man crew there were Oceana 
vessels in the vicinity who came to the rescue. All crew members 
were accounted for, and they were safely returned to shore.

The  South  African  Maritime  Safety  Authority  (SAMSA)  is 
investigating the capsizing of Restless Wave, a newbuild from 
a boatyard in St Helena Bay that was launched in August 2021.

We salute all the Oceana crew members who assisted in the 
rescue, and saved the day.

In the early hours of Sunday 26 June, Oceana vessels came to the rescue after a purse seiner capsized off Cape Point.  
All 12 members of the capsized vehicle, a newbuild from St Helena called the Restless Wave, were accounted for and taken to safety. 

VESSEL SAFETY
We emphasise safety management on our vessels. This includes 
conducting drills, reviewing standard operating procedures, and 
ensuring relevance for different types of vessels. 

All  vessel  crew  members  undergo  safety  training  courses  with 
SAMSA, in line with fishing regulations in the respective jurisdiction. 
In implementing measures for our fishers and vessels, we incorporate 
local and relevant international standards based on risks identified 
by both the company and SAMSA, as well as the ILO Work in Fishing 
Convention (No. 188), which ensures best practice is followed in 
occupational safety and health protection, conditions of work on 
board vessels, working hours, accommodation and food, medical 
care, and social security.

IMPROVEMENT IN LOST-TIME INJURIES
In 2022, we saw a 25% reduction in the total number of lost-time 
injuries recorded compared to last year. A ‘lost-time injury’ is defined 
as any incident requiring one or more days off from work. Year-on-year 
comparison has been impacted by a 14% increase in working hours, 
mainly due to the increased production as Covid-19 restrictions eased. 

In striving to prevent injuries on duty and reduce the Lost Time Injury 
Frequency Rate (LTIFR – previously the disability injury frequency rate 
DIFR), we continue to learn from investigations into the causes of injuries 
and share findings and learnings between sites. We are reviewing our 
approach to classifying injuries to ensure improved tracking of their 
severity. We are placing more focus on leading indicators, such as 

reviewing procedures; maintaining critical controls to mitigate risks; 
the number of inspections and audits undertaken; reporting non-
conformances, and progress with addressing identified issues. 

For details, please see our 2022 ESG Data Book. 

In 2023, we will increasingly be drawing on the insight of our teams 
on the ground to make projects safer and safety easier to implement.

and wellness

Fostering an 
inclusive culture

POST-PANDEMIC SUPPORT
Oceana offers basic physical and mental healthcare for all its employees 
wherever possible. This became critical during the Covid-19 pandemic, 
which considerably increased stress levels and we have learnt much 
from this experience. 

As Covid-19 restrictions eased in the countries where we operate, we 
have systemically reduced Covid-19 restrictions, while encouraging all 
our employees to take Covid-19 booster vaccinations, to use sanitiser 
and keep physical distances when working in close proximity. 

In 2022, Oceana continued to provide sample Covid-19 testing at 
our sites, providing additional medical support where needed. As 
the pandemic eased, we implemented a hybrid workspace strategy, 
allowing  those  employees  whose  presence  was  not  needed  at 
manufacturing plants or head office, to work at home where possible, 
as one of many measures to promote well-being. At the same time, we 
instituted mandatory at-work days, in the realisation that working in 
the same physical space is important for collaboration. 

PILOT PROJECT IN PRIMARY HEALTHCARE 
This year, in partnership with local health authorities, we set up a 
primary healthcare clinic for our employees at our Lucky Star facility 
at St Helena Bay. Medication is dispensed, and a range of healthcare 
services including family planning are provided at this clinic, which 
comes in addition to the normal occupational health services we 
provide at our sites. The clinic has reduced reliance on state clinics 
and minimised our employees’ downtime. Our vision is to expand 
these across further operations, building on our experience of this 
pilot programme. 

EMPLOYEE WELLNESS PROGRAMME
In promoting well-being, we have launched in partnership with a new 
service provider a comprehensive Employee Wellness Programme 
(EWP).  The EWP offers free counselling and support sessions (virtually, 
face to face and off-site) to help individuals cope with a range of 
personal challenges that can impact their work performance and 
their  family  life.  The  services  include  providing  life,  parent  and 
leadership coaching, career guidance, manager support, and legal 
and financial advice. The EWP also extends to employees’ immediate 
family members. 

OUR ALIGNMENT WITH UNGC PRINCIPLES
Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination 
in respect of employment and occupation.

We take pride in the positive engagements and relationship of mutual 
appreciation and trust with our employees. We are committed to a 
culture in which diversity, equity and inclusion are key principles, and 
several developments were aimed at deepening this culture over the 
reporting year. 

EMPLOYEE SURVEY BUILDS INCLUSION
We believe that our employees’ experiences determine 
their level of engagement, morale and commitment. In 
2022, Oceana conducted an engagement survey targeting 
our 3 000 permanent employees. “Your Voice – Our Future” 
sought to assess their thoughts and feelings about the 
Group and their working conditions, and to build trust and 
inclusion. The results are helping the leadership team to 
identify key areas of strength within the Group and focus 
areas for improvement. 

The survey was anonymous and run on several platforms, 
including a QR code on mobiles phones, on-site tablets, 
and paper. Results are being shared as available. Findings 
indicate a 53% response rate, which we are very satisfied 
with; that 65% of these respondents feel engaged with 
Oceana, and that 95% felt they could answer honestly. 

Importantly, the survey asked respondents which values 
they believe to be most important for Oceana. This was 
part of a broader process to review, analyse and establish 
core values for the Group, in such a way as to generate 
maximum team cohesion and commitment.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTIONInvesting in training and skills

Scarce skills remain a key challenge in our business. To bridge the 
skills gap, we launched the Oceana Maritime Academy in March 
2021, and a satellite centre on the West Coast next to the Lucky Star 
Operations at St Helena Bay. The Academy provides an excellent 
platform for skills development within our business, opening up 
career paths for employees at all skills levels, and strengthening our 
internal succession planning. 

Employees at all levels, and across all divisions, have embraced 
the Academy and the opportunities it offers for empowerment and 
development. We are offering a growing number of programmes 
to employees of all skills levels, as well as to the local community 
members and small-scale fishers. Looking ahead, we have signed 
an agreement with Open Sesame to deliver online training from 
October 2022. 

ACCREDITATIONS
The Academy offers the highest standard of learning in partnership with 
maritime and logistics experts STC-SA, and has SAMSA accreditation 
to run Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW) 
courses for the maritime sector. In 2022, we started the process 
of accreditation for our Marine Academy with our first intended 
accreditations in 2023. The training facility in St Helena Bay is SAMSA-
accredited. 

TRAINING PROGRAMMES 
The Academy programme is informed by a training needs analysis, 
which considers all personal development plans, team development 
requirements, and business imperatives. The Academy team works 
closely with line managers and HR teams to ensure that the training 
continues throughout the year. The Academy offers a structured range 
of training programmes across all levels to our employees, including 
tertiary programmes, learnerships, apprenticeships and formal SAMSA-
accredited Maritime Qualifications. The latter include Chief Engineer: 
Fishing and Skipper Fishing courses.

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE
This year, we invested R41 million on employee skills development 
(2021: R60 million). We deliver over 190 different types of training 
programmes a year. 

In both 2021 and 2022, we had a 100% success rate for our seafarer 
trainees who are mentored by respected industry stalwarts.

Oceana is represented on industry forums that reviews fishing-related 
skills, qualifications and related issues. 

SKILLS TRAINING HIGHLIGHTS
Pieter Williams started his Skipper Fishing theoretical 
studies in September 2020 and completed in January 
2021.  Then  he  went  back  to  sea  to  gain  more 
experience whilst studying for his Skipper Fishing oral 
exam at SAMSA. On 8 December 2021, at his second 
attempt, he received his Skipper Fishing Certificate 
of Competence. His dedication and hard work is 
inspirational.

OMAP GRADUATES PAVE THE WAY FOR FUTURE FIT OCEANA
On Thursday, 24 February, we celebrated the graduation of 30 talented leaders from business units across Oceana Group, who 
completed the 12-month-long Oceana Management Advancement Program (OMAP). Partnering with GIBS (The Gordan Institute 
of Business Science) OMAP is our certified global flagship leadership development programme, aiming to harness and further 
advance the skills of our middle management. Through it, Oceana seeks to secure and develop its talent pipeline by integrating 
and fully incorporating its young leaders into the organisation’s vision and purpose – thereby giving them a platform to shape 
the organisation’s future.

OCEANA GROUP Sustainability Report 2022AFFORDABLE NUTRITION THROUGH MARINE STEWARDSHIP AND BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENTINTRODUCTIONSupporting high-
performing teams 

Respecting 
human rights 

We encourage high levels of performance that are sustainable and 
aligned with the direction and ambitions of the business. This is 
achieved through continuous employee development and a fair and 
responsible remuneration and employee benefits policy. We undertake 
regular benchmarks of pay and conditions to ensure that we remain 
competitive, and our company’s remuneration is in line with market 
norms. We also implement a rewards programme in line with our 
scarce and critical skills development agenda. 

Clear strategic objectives and targets are set for our incentive systems, 
which include ESG and people performance measures. This year, we 
implemented a new long-term incentive scheme for our Exco and 
the management levels below to reward for performance against 
financial ESG targets.  

Succession planning is well managed across the Group, with the 
promotion  of  two  existing  employees  into  senior  management 
positions in 2022. We were able to secure all positions in the company 
this year despite the depressed local environment, with salary and 
wage increases at or slightly above inflation.

Employees performing below standard are supported through training 
and coaching within a performance improvement programme. 

Details of our remuneration policies and practices are provided in 
our Integrated Report.

 
OUR ALIGNMENT WITH UNGC PRINCIPLES: 
PRINCIPLE 1: Support and respect the protection 
of internationally proclaimed human rights
PRINCIPLE 2: Ensure we are not complicit in 
human rights abuses
PRINCIPLE 4: Eliminate all forms of forced and 
compulsory labour
PRINCIPLE 5: Ensure the effective abolition of 
child labour
PRINCIPLE 10: Businesses should work against 
corruption in all its forms, including extortion and 
bribery

Oceana’s organisational culture supports and respects local and 
internationally recognised human rights, including the principles of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises and the ILO core conventions on labour 
standards.  We  expect  all  our  employees  and  relevant  business 
partners and associates to behave ethically, always. We expect them 
to consistently show care and respect for colleagues, communities 
and the environment in which we operate.

The group’s formal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Code) 
commits all our employees to observe the highest ethical standards 
in conducting the group’s business. This includes a zero-tolerance 
approach regarding bribery and corruption. 

Our human rights policy, which is applied across all our operations, 
ensures that the human rights principles and requirements associated 
with the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) are implemented. We 
undertake an annual self-assessment review of our compliance to the 
UNGC requirements. This year, we achieved 100% compliance with 
the applicable human rights indicators (2021:98%) across the group.  

We also enforce our human rights policy and a supplier code of conduct 
in the supply chain. Supplier contracts prohibit under-age or forced 
labour, and no such incidents were reported in FY2022. 

Oceana has been a signatory to the 
United Nations Global Compact for 
nine consecutive years.

investment 

Oceana focuses on CSI initiatives that are impactful and can be 
sustained, potentially scaled up, and that seek positive impact in the 
vulnerable communities in which we operate. While focused on food 
security and the training of small-scale fishers, we remain responsive 
to the urgent needs around us, and those of communities in areas 
where unexpected disasters take place. 

This year, 1.5% of the group’s net profit after tax in South Africa was 
distributed to beneficiaries, of whom at least 75% were black. Our total 
CSI investment in South Africa for 2022 amounted to R4.7 million. For a 
further breakdown of our CSI spend, please refer to the ESG Data Book.

We regularly engage with the communities surrounding our operations 
to understand their needs and plan how we can best provide support. 
Oceana established the Hout Bay Stakeholder Engagement Forum, 
which  consists  of  representatives  of  various  local  community 
organisations, to establish the needs of the local community. This 
forum meets biannually at our Academy, or is kept abreast via a 
newsletter where physical meetings are not possible as we have seen 
in the recent past due to Covid-19.

Flagship projects

Our  flagship  projects  are  implemented  through  public-private 
partnerships (PPPs) and we work with a wide range of organisations 
including government departments and not-for-profit organisations 
such as FoodForwardSA, the Peninsula School Feeding Scheme (PFSA), 
YES Hub Gift of the Givers and the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI). 

Training  and  empowerment  of  registered  small-scale 
cooperatives: In 2021 and 2022, we travelled across the country 
to deliver training to small-scale fishers country-wide, working with 
the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE), 
the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), and Dyna Training. Further 
information on this programme, called Co-operative Sense, is presented 
in page 35.

Community skills programmes: Our Academy extends training 
opportunities to the Hout Bay community. The training projects in 
Hout Bay included pre-sea safety familiarisation, personal surviving 
techniques training, personal safety and social responsibility training, 
medical first aid and business acumen. In addition, 14 members of 
the community with disabilities received a New Venture Creation 
qualification, to help them build their own businesses.

School feeding scheme brings dignity to our learners: More than 
nine million children receive meals from government school feeding 
schemes per year. Working with PFFA revealed that participation in 
school feeding schemes would be even higher in the areas where 
meals are served if the facilities were suitable for preparing/serving 
and feeding the learners and had necessary tools to prepare and 
serve the meals. 

Our planned school feeding project was delayed in 2020 and 2021, 
as we focused on the urgent healthcare and hunger relief projects 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. This year, we completed our initial 
pilot project at H.P. Williams Primary School, which is on the Lucky 
Star grounds in St Helena Bay. We built a new containerised kitchen 
and eating area with seating, where the children can enjoy their meals 
with proper crockery and cutlery, in a safe, hygienic and welcoming 
space. We have trained the food handlers to cook delicious, nutritious 
and varied meals using Lucky Star products high on Omega’s for a 
growing child. This project is implemented in partnership with PFSA 
and Breadline Africa.

We aim to extend this pilot to a further two schools in the West Coast . 

Our Food Security Flagship follows the following five-pillar Strategy 
from concept to execution:

•  Provision of infrastructure and kitchen construction.
•  Train food handler (and future pipeline).
•  Provision of meals and feeding scheme management.
•  Education around proper nutrition.
•  Activation with Lucky Star.

Beacons for Better: Our employees go to great lengths to support 
people in need within their own communities. In 2022, we launched 
our ‘Beacons for Better’ campaign to shine a light on these efforts and 
support those most worthy. 

•  Zita Petersen, a Lucky Star export controller, helps provide education, 
food, medical help and hygiene to her community. We provided 
R10 000 to her organisation, Skye’s Wooden Spoons. 

•  Rose Watson, a crewing officer for Calamari Fishing, helps provide 
education and mentorship to youth in her community to break the 
cycle of poverty. Her organisation, Intsika Community Projects in 
the Greenbushes area of Port Elizabeth, received R10 000. 

•  Through the power of sport, Maritime Academy facilities supervisor 
James Wichman is helping to uplift at-risk youth in Hout Bay. The 
dedication and passion of the coaches positively impacts the lives 
of many players, and FS Hout Bay received R20 000.

On Mandela Day, we contributed to breaking two world records with 
the Ladles of Love team, donating more than 7 000 tins of chakalaka 
and beans for use in the NPO’s food kitchens in Johannesburg, these 
cans were first used for the green and red parts of a massive mosaic 
of the South African flag. In Cape Town, we contributed more than 
1 000 tins of chakalaka, which were used for parts of a mosaic of Nelson 
Mandela’s face. In total, more than 100 000 food cans were used in 
the mosaics, all of which were donated to the more than 200 Ladles 
of Love soup kitchens around the country.

Providing crisis support

SUPPLYING FOOD AND WATER
Oceana is geared with its partners, has the ability to provide immediate 
crisis support, to help provide for urgent requirements of communities 
in these areas, including the basic necessities of food and water. In 
recognition of the warmth and generosity of our staff, we use the term 
‘Thankful for the Gift of Giving’ to describe such projects. 

The devastating floods in KwaZulu-Natal in April 2022 left thousands 
of people destitute, homeless and in desperate need of essentials 
and services. Thousands of families had no access to clean drinking 
water. Working with Gift of the Givers, we provided a truckload of 
more than 200 five-litre bottles of drinking water. Oceana staff helped 
with collecting the water at collecting points and packing the trucks. 

Hunger constitutes a daily crisis for large numbers of South Africans. 
We continue to provide food relief through our network of partners, 
including  our annual provision of 2,4 million meals to school feeding 
schemes and over two million meals to vulnerable communities. In 
a partnership with Food Forward on World Food Day, October 16, we 
donated 5 280 tins of Lucky Star Pilchards and Baked Beans, enough 
for 26 400 meals, and packed boxes of food donations with the PFSA.

REDUCING INVASIVE FISH, INCREASING FOOD 
SECURITY
Oceana partnered with Gift of the Givers, Cape Nature and the Invasive 
Fish Species Management to address the problem of the invasive carp 
that have long plagued Garden Route fresh-water lakes, while improving 
food security for the surrounding disadvantaged communities. We 
provided a trailer-mounted freezer to allow the transport of more fish, 
further expanding the reach and benefits of the project. Each catch 
provides an average of 400 meals. To date, the project has provided 
110 000 meals to soup kitchens, and with our intervention, 1 000 meals 
per day was the target at the feeding schemes.
