About this report

The Clicks Group Sustainability Overview 2022 provides 
a summary of the group’s impact on the environment, 
society and the economy. The report focuses on the group’s 
performance for the financial year ended 31 August 2022 
and builds on the prior year report. 

This addition to the group’s reporting suite is in 
recognition of increased interest and investors’ 
expectations in relation to ESG disclosure as 
the group embeds performance-driven ESG 
practices across its sustainability focus areas. 
The sustainability overview complements the 
information provided in the integrated annual 
report 2022. 

ESG transparency and disclosure 
The group continues to enhance its disclosure 
against ESG indicators from a range of global 
ratings agencies and guidance documents. 
It is specifically working towards increased 
disclosure and transparency on climate-related 
risks and opportunities.

The group has noted the increasing 
harmonisation of global ESG disclosure 
standards and has opted to align its disclosure 
with the JSE’s recent Sustainability Disclosure 
Guidance. The JSE guidance draws on 
a wide range of recent global disclosure 
developments, including those of the 
International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB) and the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and believes 
this approach is well-placed to guide its 
sustainability disclosure efforts into the future.

Further standards or guidance frameworks with 
which the group aligns and that continue to 
inform its disclosure include: 

•  King IV Report on Corporate Governance
•  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards
•  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
•  United Nations Global Principles
•  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

This sustainability overview, read with 
the integrated annual report, corporate 
governance report, the 2022 CDP Climate 
Change submission (available in early 2023) 
and the social and ethics committee report, 
contains the data which is presently available 
to the group. As the group progresses on 
its sustainability reporting journey, it aims 
to improve and expand on its disclosures – 
informed by the JSE’s guidance. 

The group is assessed and scored against ESG 
indices, including the FTSE Russell, S&P Dow 
Jones and MSCI. It has maintained its listing on 
the FTSE4Good Index since 2015.

The group in alignment with the JSE disclosure 
guidance has adopted a double materiality 
approach to sustainability. This seeks to 
integrate ESG-related issues pertinent to the 
creation and protection of enterprise value 
highlighted in its integrated annual report.

The group has published a stand-alone 
sustainability report since 2015. 

Third party verification
Verification plays an important role in accurate, 
transparent and balanced reporting. This is 
becoming increasingly important in the global 
shift towards standardised ESG reporting. 
Accredited third party service providers have 
reviewed selected non-financial performance 
metrics, including the group’s broad-based 
black economic empowerment (BBBEE) rating 
and carbon footprint.

Sustainability  
strategy

The group is committed to increasing 
access to affordable primary 
healthcare for all South Africans. 

The group is able to achieve this 
through its retail pharmacy and 
pharmaceutical wholesale businesses. 
Founded more than 50 years ago,  
Clicks has grown into an extensive 
network of over 840 stores and  
673 pharmacies supported by  
a growing digital presence.

Like all sustainability challenges, 
affordable healthcare requires a multi-
faceted approach that can shift over 
time. The group is harnessing its brands, 
retail store network, supply chains and 
partnerships to address this and other 
related challenges.

Goals where the group believes it can have 
the most positive impact. This approach helps 
integrate sustainability thinking into every facet 
of the group. It also helps stakeholder alignment 
in deepening the link between the group’s 
business strategy and the socio-environmental 
context within which it operates.

Healthcare is a fundamental need and South Africa’s healthcare services remain 
under significant strain, primarily impacting poorer households. The group helps in 
alleviating these challenges through its expanding retail, pharmacy and clinic network, 
including offerings that serve lower income groups and underserved communities. 
Through investing in critical skills development, the group creates a pipeline of 
talented, motivated healthcare professionals which includes pharmacists. 

Expanding the group’s retail and 
pharmacy footprint

During the year, the group opened 58 new 
Clicks stores and 52 pharmacies. In continually 
expanding the store base, the group has 
increased its long-term target to 1 200 from 900, 
with plans to open 40 to 50 stores each year – 
with a pharmacy operating in each store where 
feasible, making it easier for customers to get 
access to affordable healthcare.

50% of South Africa’s population live within 
5.3km of a Clicks pharmacy. While 70% of 
the stores are in affluent areas, the group 
is steadily growing its presence in lower-
income communities to provide affordable 
healthcare access.

The group’s healthcare products and services 
cover a broad target market. The product 
offering is differentiated through a wide range 
of private label and exclusive brands. For 
convenience, customers can purchase over-
the-counter medication online or via the Clicks 
app, collect it at the nearest Clicks pharmacy 
for free or have it delivered to their home. For 
additional convenience, Clicks Virtual Doctor 
is a tele-healthcare service that provides 
convenient and affordable access to a general 
practitioner virtually.

Offerings that serve lower income groups 
include pick-up points for medication in over 
200 Clicks pharmacies, which support public 
health and reduce congestion at public clinics.

CLICKS GROUP SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW AND ESG DATABOOK 2022Building a trusted, accessible healthcare network (continued)

The continuous expansion of the group’s store 
base presents opportunities to increase access 
and affordable healthcare. 

The group offers free clinic and health outreach 
services to vulnerable patients and those 
without medical aid (see case study overleaf).

Building the healthcare skills base
The group is the largest employer of pharmacy 
staff in the private sector in South Africa 
with 929 (2021: 852) pharmacists. Given 
the shortage of qualified pharmacists and 
healthcare professionals, locally and globally, 
the group continues to place an emphasis on 
implementing a pharmacy skills development 
strategy aimed at attracting, developing, and 
retaining the skills it needs, as well as supporting 
the pharmacy sector in South Africa. 

The group has engaged with pharmacy 
schools across the country, invests in learning 
laboratories at university pharmacy schools, 
manages a pharmacy bursary scheme, 
provides workplace experience through the 
pharmacy internship programme, develops 
pharmacists’ assistants and trainees through 
learnership programmes, and maintains 
professional development of pharmacists and 
nursing practitioners.

The group awarded 88 bursaries mainly to 
pharmacy students to complete a Bachelor 
of Pharmacy degree at any registered South 
African university, as part of the group’s role in 
building the skills base for the industry.

The 199 nationwide Clicks clinics offer holistic 
primary healthcare services, including medical 
aid-funded screening tests. Through the 
Clicks Helping Hand Trust, the clinics provide 
healthcare services free of charge to the most 
vulnerable in society including patients without 
medical aid (see case study overleaf).

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the 
convenience of the group’s pharmacy network 
and the quality of the specialist healthcare 
staff underpinned the success of the group’s 
vaccination programme. The group rapidly 
scaled up vaccination sites in over 500 
pharmacies to support the government’s 
vaccination roll-out to the population. The 
group is the largest private-sector vaccination 
provider in South Africa. To date, it has 
administered more than 3.5-million doses.

Lowering the cost of healthcare
The group’s offering has a strong and 
competitive affordability component, seeking 
inclusion of lower income groups. The group 
offers consistently good value-for-money 
products delivered through competitive 
prices and effective promotions. The private 
label products offering provides affordable 
alternatives to many over-the-counter 
medicines and health products. Scheduled 
medicine ranges offer customers choice for 
quality generic medicines at a lower price. 
The pharmacies also offer a free repeat 
prescription service. 

Affordability is further enhanced by the Clicks 
ClubCard which offers generous cashback 
rewards and a range of affinity partner benefits. 
This Clicks ClubCard once again received 
accolades as one of South Africa’s most-loved 
and supported loyalty programmes. ClubCard 
has approximately 9.7 million active members, 
including 500,000 new sign-ups in the 2022 fiscal 
year and over 3 million downloaded apps. 
The platform enables the group to personalise 
engagement and communication with 
customers, particularly in an increasingly digital 
and technology-driven retail environment. 

CASE STUDY  
Responding to community healthcare needs

The group helps disadvantaged South Africans to access healthcare in communities through 
its work with the Helping Hand Trust. Founded in 2011, the Clicks Helping Hand Trust (CHHT) offers 
some of the most vulnerable members of society free preventative testing and wellness services 
at 140 clinics across the country. The CHHT also assists mothers and babies who cannot access 
government facilities through its mother and baby programme, which provides mothers with 
nutritional education, health checks and vaccinations for children. Another focus is giving advice 
on preventing HIV infection and family planning.

The CHHT provided 87 660 free primary healthcare consultative and treatment services for medical 
conditions including diabetes, HIV/AIDS, blood pressure and cholesterol, child vaccination and 
nutritional education. 

Mom and Baby programme: 
The country faces a challenge 
of child mortality exacerbated 
by lack of access to adequate 
healthcare services. The provision 
of these maternal and child health 
assessments and advice assists in 
the reduction of mortality cases.

The Girls on the Go programme 
was created to prevent girls 
missing school due to a lack of 
access to sanitary towels. This year 
it has provided over 1 500 reusable 
and more than 625 000 disposable 
sanitary pads to school girls across 
the country.

As a retailer with more than 200 suppliers associated with its private label and 
millions of customers, the group is mindful of its wide reach and the environmental 
impact across the value chain. The group is working on a broad set of solutions  
and targets to reduce its impact, with a particular focus on energy, waste, 
packaging and water. Environmental management systems are embedded in its 
business practices and operations. To strengthen its approach, the board approved 
the group’s environmental and climate change policy which outlines its approach 
and commitments.

Reducing carbon and energy
While the group has limited opportunity to 
address the national energy and climate 
challenge at scale, these environmental 
aspects provide significant impetus to its 
commitment to reduce electricity use at 
stores and distribution centres (DCs), explore 
options for renewable energy and improve the 
efficiency of its operations. 

Carbon emissions and disclosure
Minimising and accounting for direct climate 
change impacts is the group’s focus of its 
climate commitments. This year the group 
has taken decisive steps to demonstrate its 
commitment to climate action and to aligning 
with TCFD recommendations. Notably, it has 
shifted to validated science-based targets for 
its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions 
(Scope 1, 2 and 3) and formally set a long-
term group carbon commitment to be carbon 
neutral by 2050. These targets build on its 
existing targets for Scope 1 and 2 (see table 
below), in line with the Paris Agreement on 
reducing global emissions.

This year the group restated its 2021 group 
carbon footprint according to the newly 
adopted SANS/ISO 14064:2021 standard and the 
GHG protocol and updated its climate change 
metrics in line with the restated footprint. The 
resulting near-term target determined was a  
10-year target of 4.2% annual emissions 
reduction from the base year. 

The carbon neutral target will require all group 
operations to work towards this, including its 
private label suppliers and other significant 
indirect emission sources. 

The GHG emissions mainly come from 
stationary fuel combustion (diesel), mobile 
fuel combustion, fugitive emissions, purchased 
electricity, upstream distribution, employee 
commuting and business travel. A third party 
service provider verifies the group's emission 
data to assure accuracy and validity.

In progressing its alignment with TCFD 
recommendations the group has also 
introduced climate change related matters 
into the group risk register. Additionally the 
group will be publishing a stand-alone climate 
change report in 2023.

Advancing our progress
The group’s energy mix includes both 
renewable and non-renewable sources of 
energy. The use of energy includes electricity 
in stores, DCs, its head office, transportation 
(mobile and stationary combustions), and 
cooling systems. 

Renewable energy transition
The group has expanded its use of solar power 
to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy 
sources. In addition to the solar installation  
on the head office roof, the group installed 
rooftop solar panels across the seven DCs.  
The facilities collectively have approximately  
2 900 MWh installed capacity and will produce 
over 4 000 MWh energy yields in the first 
year of operations, reducing emissions by 
approximately 2%. 

Energy efficiency measures
The group has installed energy-saving 
LED lights in all its stores and DCs and uses 
extensive metering to measure energy usage. 
Store lighting is managed through either 
motion sensors, occupancy sensors or time 
controls that automatically switch off lights 
when not needed.

The group has maintained the UPD route 
planning optimisation initiative which identifies 
the best possible routes for driver when 
delivering products and limits driving to  
80km/h, saving fuel and reducing emissions. 

Conserving freshwater
The group consumes relatively small amounts 
of water and relies on municipal supplies. 
Water is used primarily at stores for hygiene and 
sanitation, and by pharmacists and nurses for 
cleaning equipment and mixing medication.

Inadequate access to water and water 
unavailability are major concerns in Southern 
Africa, a water stressed region, and has the 
potential to disrupt the group’s operations. 

The group has decreased its reliance on 
municipal water to its head office, by harvesting 
rainwater and using ground borehole water 
sources. It has also installed ground water 
boreholes at its Centurion distribution centre. 
The group has adopted water conservation 
measures across the business. The group aims 
to maintain water consumption at not more 
than 5% above the 2022 baseline. 

The group has increased the scope of water 
consumption reporting for this current reporting 
year to include three leased DCs.

Reducing waste and pollution
The group strives to reduce and manage its 
waste streams to minimise effects on human 
health and the environment, and to promote 
the concept of the circular economy to 
eliminate or repurpose “waste” into new 
resources.

The group raises awareness with employees 
to reduce waste in stores and DCs and 
has systems in place to collect recyclable 
material. It has initiated separate waste stream 
processes onsite at its head office and DCs.  
For waste streams requiring specialised 
disposal, such as medical waste, fluorescent 
light bulbs, printer cartridges and hazardous 
waste, the group outsources collection to 
certified service providers, and obtains safe 
disposal certificates. 

The group recycled 78% of its total waste 
generated in 2022. 

The group, at its head office, has embarked on 
a zero waste to landfill journey, implementing 
a stringent waste management plan focusing 
on diversion of a range of waste streams from 
landfill. 

The group complies with government’s 
Extended Producer Responsibility regulations 
aimed at incentivising industry to facilitate 
packaging waste recycling. The group 
also forms part of various existing Producer 
Responsibility Organisations tasked with setting 
mandatory levies producers and has to pay 
for respective waste streams. It is a member 
of Polyco for plastic waste and of eWASA for 
electrical and electronic equipment, lighting 
and paper and packaging sectors.

Reducing packaging and plastic usage
Product packaging presents a key opportunity 
to demonstrate the group's commitment 
to responsible product stewardship. There 
is increasing concern about the resources 
used in the production of packaging, notably 
plastic, as well as the impact that packaging 
has on the environment if it is not recycled or 
disposed of adequately. To this end, the group 
participates in collective efforts to work towards 
long-term common targets for the plastics value 
chain. 

The group is a member of the SA Plastics Pact 
and committed to joint industry targets by 2025. 
The SA Plastics Pact has set the following key 
goals for its members by 2025: 

•  100% of its members’ packaging re-usable  

or recyclable 

•  25% recycled content from plastic  

waste across all its members’ packaging 
requirements

•  100% of cardboard and paper used its 

members’ packaging to be sourced from 
responsibly managed forests

The group’s MyEarth range of eco-friendly 
products are packaged in recyclable plastic 
packaging or plastic-free packaging made 
from sustainable paper, all with recycled 
content where possible. 

The group strives to reduce its packaging in 
other areas which include secondary plastic 
on gifts, and progressively using more recycled 
material in private label packaging. The 
group has continued to innovate to reduce its 
packaging impacts. For example, the group was 
the first retailer in South Africa to make use of 25% 
of PhoenixPET in its bottled water packaging, 
and has also phased plastic microbeads out of 
all its private label products. The group has also 
phased out plastic straws, and introduced eco-
conscious cotton buds made from 100% organic 
cotton tips with paper stems. 

The group sells durable reusable and recyclable 
bags in its stores.

As a leading health, wellness and beauty retailer in South Africa, the group 
embraces the opportunity to positively impact lives while promoting smart, 
sustainable and inclusive product supply chains. This includes supporting small and 
medium sized local suppliers to become part of the retail sector, thus contributing 
to much needed economic recovery and job creation. It also means working with 
all its suppliers to ensure that it provides customers with high quality products that 
are produced responsibly and ethically. The group also actively works with local 
suppliers to expand its range of high quality products at affordable prices. 

Building an inclusive supply chain
The group’s large supply chain presents a 
significant opportunity for local supply chain 
support and small, medium and micro-size 
enterprises (SMME) development, which is 
critical in creating jobs and building a healthier 
and more resilient economy. 

beneficial payment terms, shared shelf space, 
and business mentorship, including incubation 
support from the various teams.

The platform contributed to getting the group 
to its current total of 546 listed SMMEs of which 
more than 47% are black owned and 23% of 
that base are black women-owned.

Total spend on suppliers of goods and services 
exceeded R35 billion this year. This included a 
67% weighted BEE procurement expenditure, 
with continued transformation of the 
supplier base.

The group’s enterprise and supplier 
development (ESD) initiatives are steadily 
increasing its support of small and medium 
sized suppliers with the spend on SMMEs up 
by 7.3% y-o-y to R1.4billion, of which R1.1 billion 
was with black-owned businesses, including 
R798 million with black women-owned 
suppliers.

In boosting small local businesses, the group 
implemented a SMME supplier listing portal that 
aims to ease entry into its market access eco-
system. Through the platform, it gives new small 
supplier partners commercial and business 
support in the form of marketing, promotions, 

This year the group invested R67 million in ESD 
initiatives (2021: R65 million). Furthermore it paid 
R42 million to 65 owner drivers as part of the 
UPD supplier development programme. 

A particular target area for SMME 
growth in recent years has been local 
hair care brands, with a significant 
investment in black women-owned 
businesses. Some of the brands the 
company has worked with include 
AfroBotanics, AfriBerry and Portia M. 
At the end of FY22, the group helped 
65 black owned businesses (trade 
suppliers). This includes Masodi 
Organics’ range of natural hair and 
body products and Kaio, which is 
AfroBotanics’ multicultural hair range.

Ensuring responsible sourcing
As the group commits to supporting local 
suppliers, it is imperative that the business 
builds on current efforts to promote, track and 
support ethics and sustainable practices across 
supplier network.

The group’s initiatives in building responsible 
supply chains are driven by its values and 
supported by its code of conduct and supplier 
code of ethics. All suppliers are required to sign 
(and re-sign every two years) these agreements 
which are aligned to the UN Global Compact. 
This addresses the group’s requirements 
across areas including labour practices, 
safety and health, environmental stewardship, 
governance and ethics, and transformation.

In developing the private label range, the 
group focuses on sourcing from an accredited, 
reputable and audited supplier base. It 
evaluates new suppliers and re-evaluates 
existing suppliers using a scorecard to assist 
in identifying supply chain risks. In selecting 
suppliers, the group prioritises those that 
demonstrate a greater commitment to 
responsible practices. The group fosters strong 

trusted partnerships to encourage reporting 
of any non-compliance. Additionally the 
group also works with suppliers to ensure that 
they conform to specification standards and 
product development testing procedures. It 
conducts supplier audits against standards 
on various criteria. If suppliers are in breach 
of any obligations, immediate corrective 
measures must be taken in order to maintain 
the contract. 

The group actively encourages its suppliers to 
participate in initiatives like the SA Plastics Pact 
and to develop products that contain recycled 
content and support a circular economy. 

Offering products with sustainability 
attributes
The group partners with suppliers that support 
innovation and differentiation. Spearheading its 
exploration of sustainable product innovation, 
the Clicks’ MyEarth range offers an eco-friendly 
range for consumers who seek in the main 
sustainable attributes. 

The MyEarth range of daily essential products 
use recyclable plastic packaging or plastic-
free packaging made from sustainable paper, 
all with recycled content where possible. The 
growing range also offers reusable products 
made from bamboo, hemp, natural rubber and 
organic cotton as well as personal care items 
such as bamboo combs and hairbrushes, and 
toothbrushes made from recycled plastic waste. 

The group also promotes an extensive range 
of beauty and personal care products across 
brands that are free from chemicals such as 
phthalates and parabens. 

In striving to provide customers with greater 
choice and transparency the group has 
continued to expand its range of private label 
and branded beauty products that promote 
animal welfare – products that have a “cruelty 
free” or “vegan friendly” stamp on them, or 
products with environmental or social attributes 
– such as products free from sulphates, 
parabens, or fragrances, and products with 
sustainable packaging (see page 17).

Maintaining product safety, quality 
and responsible marketing
The group is committed to providing customers 
with quality products that meet high health 
and safety requirements. All suppliers are 
screened for product quality and compliance. 
The group maintains stringent standards across 
its supply chain. It has adopted strict quality 
assurance processes to limit the risk of product 
failure and non-compliance. Product recall 
standards and procedures are also in place.

The group responds to and follows up on all 
product enquiries, concerns or complaints.  
All material customer enquiries and complaints 
are investigated and addressed.

The group adheres to the Code of Advertising 
Practice administered by the Advertising 
Regulatory Board, which regulates South 
African advertising content. The group also 
has an Advertising Advisory Committee 
that convenes regularly to assess all 
marketing material to ensure that it lives up 
to its commitments to fair and representative 
marketing. In addition, all marketing practices 
within the group are conducted in accordance 
with the requirements of POPIA.

South Africa for the sixth consecutive 
year by the Top Employers Institute.

Supporting high performing teams
The group invests in building a strong and 
diverse leadership team and an agile, 
performance-based, company culture.  
The high levels of commitment and 
performance demonstrated by its workforce, 
amid the enduring challenges of the Covid-19 
pandemic and ongoing rolling blackouts, is 
testament to the quality of people and the

Promoting diversity, equity and 
inclusion
The group promotes a workplace that is 
supportive, fair, adaptable and involving 
of all, where every colleague is valued and 
respected for who they are and can fulfil 
their potential.

The group’s Code of Conduct and values set 
out the behaviours expected of all employees. 
The group has a zero-tolerance approach to 
bullying, harassment, gender based violence 
(GBV) and victimisation. The employee wellness 
programme (EWP) includes initiatives aimed at 
creating awareness around GBV and ensuring 
that it promotes and maintains a safe, secure 
and productive work environment

The group implements an anonymous and 
secure whistle-blowing facility to facilitate 
the confidential reporting of concerns about 
potentially unethical, unlawful or unsafe 
conduct or practices that conflict with 
company values and code of conduct. 

The group has continued to make good 
progress in ensuring equity within the 
organisation through good governance, 
policies and practices and building a 
culture that enables diversity and inclusion. 
The majority of its workforce is women 
with representation across all levels of the 
organisation. The group welcomed Bertina

becoming the first black woman to lead a listed 
retail group in South Africa.

Empowerment Gender Gap Analysis 
evaluation, a business-driven tool designed 
to help organisations assess gender equality 
performance across leadership and 
strategy, in the work and marketplace and 
in the community. 

Encouragingly, the group achieved a result 
well ahead of the norm beginner-improver 
category, presenting in the achiever category 
(63%). The assessment has enabled it to 
understand the areas where it leads, as well as 
areas for development and improvement.

Protecting and supporting 
employees
The group is committed to maintaining safe, 
healthy conditions in the stores, pharmacies, 
clinics and DCs, and to supporting the good 
health and wellbeing of employees. The 
Covid-19 pandemic elevated the importance of 
health, safety and wellbeing within the group.

The group’s approach has always been to raise 
awareness, inspire and motivate people to look 
after their wellbeing. Supporting the mental 
wellbeing of the workforce was critical during 
the Covid-19 pandemic, which increased 
levels of stress, and the group has continued 
to implement mental health and resilience 
interventions. In promoting wellbeing, the group 
encourages employees to make use of the 
award-winning EWP which is built on a holistic 
wellbeing model. The EWP, through a third 
party service provider, offers free independent, 

confidential, professional counselling and 
advisory services, virtually or face to face, 
to help individuals cope with a range of 
personal challenges that can impact their work 
performance and their family. To increase levels 
of engagement, the group promotes wellbeing 
coaching and online learning modules. The 
EWP also extends to employees’ immediate 
household dependants. It is available 24/7 in all 
official South African languages.

The group encourages employees to complete 
wellness screenings, including blood pressure, 
glucose, cholesterol, body mass index and HIV 
tests during the wellness days, which are held 
nationally across its business.

This year more than 20% of employees made 
use of the EWP.

The group continues to fund the cost of 
primary health insurance for more than 80% of 
employees not covered by medical aid.
