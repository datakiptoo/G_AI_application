ESG APPENDIX 2022

FORWARD ARROW:BACK ARROW:OUR ESG PERFORMANCE DATA

We actively participate in various 
national and global industry 
associations and voluntary 
initiatives to advance social, 
environmental and governance 
best conduct in our business 
activities.

We adhere to the principle of combined assurance 
This year, Distell’s internal audit team mapped out the controls that support our environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) reporting and formally integrated ESG into the Group’s combined assurance programme.
Our combined assurance programme aims to help board and management identify assurance gaps as well as opportunities to reduce duplication of efforts. The 
programme further provides the board with a framework for delegating risk responsibility and for obtaining and aggregating assurance from across the various 
governance and assurance groups. Furthermore, the combined assurance programme seeks to achieve the following specific objectives:
 • Enable an effective control environment
 • Support the integrity of information used for internal decision-making by management, the governing body and its committees
 • Support the integrity of the Distell’s external reports
This year, work performed included facilitating risk and controls workshops with Distell’s ESG process and control owners, identifying the relevant risks and 
controls, mapping assurance activities performed across the different assurance providers, and assessing for any gaps with controls and assurance coverage for 
our ESG reporting.

As an outcome of the work performed, neither management nor internal audit identified any material ESG control weaknesses or deficiencies. In the year ahead, 
internal audit will review the supporting internal control processes and activities of our combined assurance programme. 

We are recognised by 
independent ESG rating and 
research agencies for our leading 
practices.

Distell ESG Appendix 2022FORWARD ARROW:BACK ARROW:APPLICATION OF THE UNGC PRINCIPLES
The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) is a strategic initiative that encourages businesses worldwide to adopt socially responsible policies and practices 
to achieve sustainable development.

We joined the UNGC as a signatory in 2013. In 2020, we strengthened 
our involvement and increased our level of engagement from signatory 
to participant. This enables us to engage with the UNGC at a global level 
as well as nationally, which will accelerate our sustainability efforts and 
scale up our impact.

Recent milestones:
 • Participating in South Africa’s Voluntary National Review 2019, a 

process through which countries assess and present progress made 
in achieving the SDGs – with Distell featured as a best practice 
example of private sector support of the SDGs. 

 Read more here.

 • Participating in the 

 SDG Pioneers programme (a Distell employee 

was recognised as second runner-up in the 2019 UNGC Network/
South Africa Young SDG Pioneers programme) and 
Programme, a development programme for future business leaders 
and changemakers designed to accelerate business innovation and 
unlock new business opportunities.

 SDG Innovator 

 • We are committed to aligning our business activities and outcomes 

with the SDGs and we have identified four primary and two 
foundational SDGs. These SDGs and relevant targets are mapped to 
business priorities, risks and opportunities and are aligned with 
a Group-wide STI scorecard (Read more in our Sustainability Report, 
available online).

The ten principles of the UNGC are integrated into Distell’s way 
of working and are therefore incorporated into either a policy, 
process or activity. We outline our integration of the UNGC 
principles into our business below:
Human rights
Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the 
protection of internationally proclaimed human rights 
 • Distell’s global Human Rights Policy is publicly available through our 
corporate website. This policy outlines the human rights principles 
that we commit to as the bedrock of our operations, alongside the 
implementation, monitoring and remedial systems we have in place 
to ensure that we adhere to the broad spectrum of rights set out in 
the principles. 

 Download our Human Rights Policy 

 • Informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, we work within the framework of the International Bill of 
Human Rights, the ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work, and the UNGC, to which we are a participant.

Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human 
rights abuses
 • Distell’s Responsible Sourcing Policy, which was revised and 

relaunched in 2022, sets out the minimum standards we expect from 
our suppliers, as well as the journey towards sustainably embedding 
responsible business practices into their operations. Our Responsible 
Sourcing Policy is publicly available on our corporate website. 

 Download our Responsible Sourcing Policy

 • Suppliers must comply with all applicable local, national and 

international laws and regulations. We uphold the highest standards 
wherever we operate in the world. This means that we defer to 
international best practice in relation to business conduct and human 
rights, even in challenging regulatory environments. We work with 
suppliers to ensure that this approach is taken across our 
value chain.

Labour
Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of 
association and the effective recognition of the right to 
collective bargaining
 • Distell endorses the principle of freedom of association. We 

recognise that workers are better able to monitor and uphold their 
human rights in the workplace when they are free to form and join 
trade unions, and collectively bargain for their mutual interests 
without fear of intimidation. 

 • Trade union members and officials have access to facilities at the 

workplace in accordance with applicable legislation and site policies 
and procedures.

Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and 
compulsory labour
 • We do not permit any form of forced labour, debt bondage or prison 

labour within our operations and supply chain.

 • Employees chose their employment freely and no original 

identification documents and/or passports are retained. Employees 
are not required to pay any deposit before their work commences.

 • Distell recognises the fact that any person may work for an employer 

of his/her choice. At no point in time will Distell or any of its 
managers/supervisors force any employee to remain in the employ 
of the Company against their will and/or intention.

Distell ESG Appendix 2022FORWARD ARROW:BACK ARROW:APPLICATION OF THE UNGC PRINCIPLES CONTINUED

Labour continued
Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour
 • Distell operates as a business that prohibits all forms of child labour 
and exploitation. In line with international standards, Distell upholds 
the ILO’s Minimum Age Convention 138 across our operations and 
supply chain. Distell only employs those who are 18 years old and 
above, and in all cases take reasonable steps to verify the age of 
workers upon employment.

 • The Company will take appropriate measures to remediate the 

situation where child labour is found to be present at the workplace.
Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of 
employment and occupation
 • We aim to be a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic organisation 

dedicated to employee development by creating a culture of 
inclusivity and promoting equal opportunities for all of our employees. 
This will enable Distell to reap the benefits of the varied perspectives 
and approaches that members of different identity groups bring to 
the workplace.

 • Distell takes a zero-tolerance approach to harassment and 

discrimination. With regards to employment status and treatment, no 
Distell worker or partner will be discriminated against due to factors 
such as race, religion, colour, ethnicity, national origin, disability, 
sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, marital 
status or other arbitrary means.

 • Equal opportunities for promotion and training are available without 

regard to gender or racial identity or other arbitrary grounds.

Environment
Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary 
approach to environmental challenges
 • Distell evaluates the environmental risks and opportunities associated 

with our manufacturing activities to continuously improve on our 
environmental performance, according to the principles of the ISO 
14001:2015: EMS standard. 

 • Distell has procedures in place to ensure the integration of legal 

requirements into business processes, focusing on pollution 
prevention.

Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater 
environmental responsibility
 • We are a proud founding member of the Stellenbosch River 

Collaborative and an active participant in the CoGo initiative, both 
of which are working hard to restore health to the rivers in the 
Eerste River Catchment. 

 • Our choice to become a founding member of SA Plastics Pact supports 

our strong focus on the SDGs, particularly SDGs 8, 12 and 17.

 • We are proud to report that only 1% of our total packaging by weight 

is plastic. This achievement is the result of our journey and 
commitment to lead the way in responsible and sustainable packaging 
that considers people and planet as much as profit.

Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of 
environmentally friendly technologies
 • We monitor performance against our aspirational goals for 2025 related 

to water, electricity, fossil-fuel-based energy usage, GHG emissions 
and wastewater discharged.

 • We promote the use of renewable electricity at our production sites. 
 • We reduce our non-energy related GHG emissions by capturing, 
purifying and using the CO2 released during the fermentation of 
apple juice for cider production and fermentation of grain for whisky 
production to carbonate our products.

Anti-corruption
Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption 
in all its forms, including extortion and bribery
 • Distell is committed to doing ethical and sound business and complying 

fully with local and international anti-bribery and corruption laws. 
This includes continuously conducting our business with integrity 
and with proper regard for ethical business practices. Distell has a 
zero-tolerance approach to acts of bribery and corruption by personnel 
or anyone acting on its behalf. We expect all of our directors and 
employees to comply with these principles and to act in the best 
interest of the Group at all times.

 • No Distell employee or associated person may directly or indirectly 

bribe a government official or any third party. Similarly, no Distell 
employee or associated person may receive anything of value in 
exchange for performing their duties disloyally or illegally. 

11

Any demand for, or offer of, a bribe must be rejected immediately and 
reported to the Distell compliance department.

 • In respect of gifting, no Distell employee may give, offer, promise 

or authorise the giving of anything of value to a government official 
or anyone else, directly or through an intermediary, such as an agent 
or business partner, to influence official action or to obtain 
an improper advantage.

 • Giving and receiving gifts and entertainment have a role to play in 
building business relationships. However, the acceptance of gifts 
or the giving thereof should never create improper influences or 
obligate the recipient to perform in return. The proposed gift or 
entertainment should be appropriate in value and nature considering 
local custom, the position of the recipient and the circumstances.

 • All employees and business partners must remain vigilant in 

preventing, detecting and reporting any suspected illegal, 
non-compliant or unethical behaviour. Distell provides an Ethics Line 
which is managed by an independent party to combat this kind of 
conduct. Reports can be made anonymously. 

 • Distell undertakes to thoroughly investigate all matters reported and 
take the necessary legal, civil or disciplinary steps flowing from such 
investigation.

REFERENCES
Respecting society’s increasing expectations for greater transparency around climate change, we are aligning our management and reporting approach to 
follow the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s TCFD. 

The TCFD enables companies to provide information across four areas: climate-change governance, risk, 
strategy and performance. Distell’s response to the risks posed by climate change is covered primarily in our 
submissions to the CDP, which we regard as a leading measure of a business’s carbon strategy, disclosure and 
performance. Distell received an A- rating in CDP Water and a BB for CDP Climate based on our 
2021 submissions.

1  In previous reporting years, the annual CDP submission date was before the end of our financial year. We therefore report our 
performance against our prior financial year as we are unable to capture all data for the current financial year before the required 
CDP submission date. Therefore, the CDP performance score featured in this year’s Sustainability Report (and available on our 
corporate website) is based on FY21 submission of the FY20 data, with score reported in the FY22 Sustainability Report.

As part of our commitment to advance our ESG reporting, we added a SASB index to our ESG disclosures this year. 

We are taking steps to align our accounting metrics and units of measure with the guidance included in the SASB Standards. However, we believe it is important to provide our stakeholders with our response to the key 
sustainability issues most likely to impact our business – as guided by the SASB Standards. This table below references the Standard for the Alcoholic Beverages industry with links to where the relevant information can be 
found on in our Sustainability Report or on our website.
