TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORT01INTRODUCTIONABOUT THIS REPORT

This ESG and Climate Change Report represents a significant 
milestone in our 18-year history of sustainability reporting, and is 
the business’s attempt to respond to rapidly evolving expectations 
for environmental, social and governance (ESG) transparency and 
accountability. This includes:

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Increased interest in ESG performance data from longer-term 
investor analysts (e.g. pension funds, particularly international 
funds).
Increased requests for ESG performance data, systems and 
controls information, from key customers.
Increasing frequency and depth of requests for ESG information 
from local and international ESG analysts such as MSCI, DJSI and 
other sustainability indexes.
Increased expectations from a variety of role players for additional 
transparency and accountability around climate change matters 
to provide evidence that Tongaat Hulett is actively contributing 
to addressing global, national and corporate commitments to 
combatting climate change.
Increased interest in climate change reporting, specifically with 
respect to reporting aligned to the reporting recommendations 
of the TCFD.

For the first time, Tongaat Hulett has chosen to produce a 
combined ESG and Climate Change Report that not only supports 
the company’s full suite of Integrated Annual Reporting documents, 
but also to provide step change improvements in: 

•  The depth and breadth of our ESG disclosures via a 

comprehensive ESG data table placed upfront to assist 
responsible investment analysts who focus the bulk of their effort 
on understanding key performance data.

•  The way in which case studies within the report are structured 

around explaining the meaning behind our data.

•  The way in which we have chosen to explain, in much greater 

detail than in prior years, how our commitments to the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the UN Global 
Compact (UNGC) are linked to specific aspects of our business.

•  The setting of specific targets for future monitoring, management 

and reporting back to our stakeholders.

•  Ensuring improved alignment to the TCFD.

This report is the product of a year of intense effort to reinvigorate 
the way in which sustainability is understood, actively managed, 
and engrained in as many process improvements as possible. 
Behind the numerical performance data and the stories that flow 
from that data, is a collective commitment within the company to 
identify areas where the health and welfare of our employees and 
community members, the sustainability of our suppliers, contractors 
and other partners, and the protection of the natural environment 
in which we operate can be improved while continuing to focus on 
shareholder value. As a company with more than 128 years history, 
we understand the need to respect the interests of our lenders 
and investors, but not at the expense of the air, water and land we 
rely on to support the growth and development of the sugar we 
produce, and the land we develop.

After a year where we refrained from seeking assurance over our 
sustainability report due to multiple changes within our business, 
BDO now provides assurance over the reporting outcomes of the 
rapidly improving policies, procedures, systems and controls that 
allow Tongaat Hulett to produce a report of this nature. 

SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES
This report reviews Tongaat Hulett following a multi-year process 
of transformation within the group. With the sale of our operations 
in Namibia and Eswatini, as well as that of the starch business and 
the mothballing of our Darnall Mill, the company we present to 
our stakeholders is a much leaner and more efficient entity. It is this 
company, as represented in the “Our Business Model” section on 
page 12 of this report, that we report on for the period of  
1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021. The information included in this 
report covers the activities of the group and all its subsidiaries and 
aligns with the financial information disclosed in the Integrated 
Annual Report and Annual Financial Statements.

In some cases, such as with the presentation of Person Hours 
Worked (PHW), injuries, and injury frequency rates, the decision 
was taken to include data for all prior operations up to the date of 
their sale. 

MATERIALITY
The determination of materiality for the purposes of this 
report has occurred through operation and group specific 
risk management protocols that were redeveloped and 
implemented over the past year. This includes the identification 
of key sustainability matters within the outcomes of audit and 
risk analyses, Safety, Health, Environment, Quality and Security 
(SHEQS) materiality reviews, and a more targeted identification 
and prioritisation of Tongaat Hulett’s climate change risks.  
These processes are discussed in detail in both the Integrated 
Annual Report and later in this document on page 23.

MEASUREMENT METHODS AND COMPARABILITY
Following a challenging process to clean up an Excel-based 
information management system to collect, collate and report key 
sustainability, this report represents the last year that data will be 
gathered using these obsolete processes. All data reported as of 
1 April of this year will be presented via a custom designed data 
management system that will improve the accuracy, consistency, 
completeness and reliability of all of the data we present to our 
stakeholders. It is our hope that as Tongaat Hulett continues to 
provide greater access to ESG information, our investors, providers 
of capital and other stakeholders will begin to use our performance 
data to gain a better understanding of how Tongaat Hulett plans to 
remain a going concern.

Due to the significant improvements made throughout the 
company to provide a greater amount of more complete and 
reliable data, as well as the reshaping of our corporate footprint,  
we caution users of this report to consider that not all data will be 
fully comparable from one year to the next. However, we believe 
that as we emerge from our process to retool our SHEQS teams,  
the ultimate comparability of our data will continue to improve.

RESTATEMENTS 
Where data has been updated to reflect increases in knowledge 
and experience backdated to historical information, notes to 
stakeholders have been included to specifically highlight and 
explain why a restatement has occurred. In most cases,  
re-statements do not reflect a prior error in reporting, but rather 
access to data that was not previously available at one or more 
business operations. Prior year data in these cases has been 
included to improve the quality of performance trend analyses.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTOUR APPROACH02APPROACH  
TO SUSTAINABILITY

There is increasing demand from investors for more robust data on ESG performance  
to inform their capital allocation decisions. Focus on ESG considerations is also  
mounting from customers, who are increasingly looking to confirm social and 
environmental responsibility in their supply chains, often to the extent of conducting 
supplier audits to ensure compliance to their own requirements. 

As Tongaat Hulett’s focus shifts to cementing the longer-term 
sustainability of the group, the ESG agenda is receiving renewed 
focus and a new sustainability management framework has been 
introduced. We are committed to moving beyond compliance 
and reporting to effectively demonstrating how ESG matters 
are embedded in the organisation to manage risk and improve 
operational efficiency.

Our sustainable development initiatives and processes are 
aligned to Tongaat Hulett’s new strategy and values, and play an 
integral part in achieving our vision and mission. Our approach 
to ESG is informed by consistent engagement with a broad range 
of stakeholders and by relevant ESG guidelines and protocols 
including the UN Declaration of Human Rights. 

CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED  
IN THIS PERIOD
•  Twenty deaths at our operations, of which one was  
work related, seven non-work related and 12 related  
to third-parties.

•  Debt reduction and further restructuring.
•  Material adverse change (MAC) dispute delayed sale 

of starch and glucose business.

•  Loss of sugar at our South African sugar refinery.
•  Community unrest at the Darnall Mill.

FOCUS AREAS FOR 2022
•  Zero fatalities and improved health and safety 

performance.

•  Further progress with the debt reduction programme.
• 

Improving our ability to access attractive and strategically 
important markets.
Investing in new capabilities to enable high performance 
and a future fit organisation.

CLIMATE CHANGE  
AND SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

As with all risks, sustainability is a critical influencer of short-, medium- and long-term success within Tongaat Hulett, and as with all risks, sound 
corporate governance principles are at the heart of our strategy for managing the impacts we believe climate change and other sustainability 
matters could potentially have on our business. Empowering a dedicated team of experts to implement effective policies, procedures, systems 
and controls to identify, prioritise, mitigate and report on sustainability risks and opportunities, Tongaat Hulett strives to protect shareholder 
value. To manage this process, responsibility for sustainability and climate change risk is omni-directional, flowing up from the shop floor to the 
Board, and down again through group, country and site management structures, while also flowing reciprocally between Tongaat Hulett and 
its customers, suppliers, contractors, communities and other key stakeholders.

The SEHSC is responsible for ensuring effective monitoring, 
oversight and decision-making with respect to all relevant 
policies and procedures, inclusive of the following

MANAGEMENT 
RESPONSIBILITY
Ultimate responsibility for the day-to-day 
management of ESG and associated risks 
resides with the executive committee 
(Exco) at the group level, in the capacity 
of the group executive for Business 
Assurance. The group executive for 
Human Resources (HR) is similarly 
responsible for the management of all 
Human Capital risks, opportunities and 
developmental requirements. The group 
Company Secretary is responsible for the 
management of governance related risks.

At the country/operational level 
the country executive for Business 
Assurance – reporting into the country 
head and to the group executive for 
Business Assurance – is responsible 
for sustainability, while the country HR 
executive – reporting into the country 
head and to the group executive for 
HR – is responsible for all Human Capital 
matters. The in-country company 
secretaries are responsible for the 
management of governance related 
matters and report into the group 
Company Secretary.

The extent to which executives are held 
accountable for the safety, health and 
development of the Tongaat Hulett 
workforce has escalated in recent years, 
with remuneration being impacted by 
specific performance targets within  
short- and long-term incentive 
programmes (STI/LTI). For example, a 
significant proportion of bonuses are now 
linked to annual targets for the number of 
person days lost due to injuries on duty 
(IODs), while both STI and LTI plans are 
directly linked to the recently established 
targets to improve energy, carbon and 
water efficiency throughout the group 
(excepting for year one of all new targets).

AUDIT AND ASSURANCE
The Safety, Health and Environment (SHE)
team underwent a process of significant 
change and improvement over the past 
year, seeking to move from being a data 
gathering and reporting function,  
to one of greater oversight and support 
for sustainability performance within 
the operations. This began with a 
review of all SHE policies, procedures, 
systems and controls, moving further 
to the development of a soon-to-
be implemented sustainability data 
management system that has been 
custom designed for our unique 
environment. The roll out of this system 
will be combined with Tongaat Hulett’s 
most rigorous training and development 
programme for the SHE teams at each 
operation, coupled with a process of 
identifying where additional skills and 
capacity need to be developed to 
manage the increasingly complex nature 
of ESG management and reporting.

To improve the reliability and 
comparability of Tongaat Hulett’s ESG 
data, the ESG team conducts regular site 
visits to the operations to perform internal 
audit reviews of site-specific information. 
This includes adjusting standard 
operating procedures to accommodate 
for challenges some sites may face in 
obtaining or verifying performance data. 
Where necessary, the ESG team will call 
upon Internal Audit to investigate specific 
performance data challenges.

To maximise the accuracy, consistency, 
completeness and reliability of all of 
the group’s ESG data, Tongaat Hulett 
continues to engage an independent 
third-party assurance provider on an 
annual basis. As of the 2021 financial year, 
this service is provided by BDO. 

21

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTOUR APPROACH02MEDIUM-TERM ESG STRATEGY

Tongaat Hulett has made considerable progress with its turnaround strategy since it was implemented in 2019. The strategy comprises 
12 management initiatives that also drive the medium-term ESG strategy. In the year under review the company concluded the sale of its 
starch and glucose business to Barloworld for R5.35 billion, disposed of the Namibian packaging operation and received the proceeds from 
the sale of the Tambankulu Estate in Eswatini. The group’s strategic transformational partnerships, while decelerated by COVID-19, continue 
to be progressed.

OUR MOST MATERIAL ISSUES

The determination of ESG and climate change materiality occurs 
through the operations and group-specific risk management protocols 
that were redeveloped and implemented over the past year.  
This includes the identification of key sustainability matters within the 
outcomes of audit and risk analyses, SHEQS materiality reviews, and 
a more targeted identification and prioritisation of Tongaat Hulett’s 
climate change risks. 

Our primary sources of materiality information come from a combination of both internal 
and external stakeholder engagement. Through daily management meetings and toolbox 
talks with employees a variety of issues are discussed, where those deemed to be of a 
greater frequency and/or severity are prioritised within the site-specific risk mapping 
processes. The same process occurs with our regular interactions with key stakeholders 
at the local, regional, national and international level, noting that materiality can include 
either internal or external issues and/or a combination of both. An example of this is the 
risk related to water which is considered to be a material risk for the business.  

Tongaat Hulett’s operations and its suppliers of sugarcane are high users of water and 
therefore this natural resource is very important to the business. The need to engage 
with key stakeholders who are users of water in and around our operations, as well as the 
predicted increases in periods of drought due to climate change are some of the reasons 
why water is regarded as one of the business’s most material issue.

Resulting from our determination process, our most material issues (in order of appearance 
in this report) are noted below:

•  COVID-19
•  Human Capital management
•  Training and development
•  Benefits
•  Ethics
•  Health and Safety
•  Transformation, localisation and the upliftment of women
•  Stakeholder relationships
•  Sustainable agriculture
•  Human rights and child labour
•  Supply chain
•  Food safety
• 
Intellectual property
•  Product responsibility
•  Land management
•  Waste management
•  Water
•  Air (including carbon emissions)
•  Climate change

This report is structured in such a way as to provide greater detail, inclusive of quantitative 
data to measure our performance, in each of the relevant sections, as defined by the  
IIRC <IR> Framework.

CASE STUDY: TONGAAT HULETT’S COVID-19 RESPONSE
The World Health Organization (WHO) first declared COVID-19 a world health emergency in January 2020 and the 
pandemic rapidly evolved into a global public health crisis. Around the world, governments adopted policies to lock 
down economic and social activities to contain the spread of the virus. The effect on industry was severe due to the 
impact of import and export controls, border closures that prevented the movement of people, disruption of supply 
chains, production halts, reduced consumer spending arising from large-scale job cuts and business closures and the 
subsequent decline in revenue generation.
Sugar production was classified as an essential service and Tongaat Hulett was permitted to operate through all levels of 
the lockdowns in all its countries of operation. Very early in the process, we set up a COVID-19 war room to coordinate 
the company’s response and a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) was put into place to address the emerging economic and 
social challenges, and to ensure continuity of operations.
The BCP focused on three priority areas:

HEALTHY PEOPLE  |  HEALTHY COMPANY  |  HEALTHY COMMUNITY
Our primary objective was to ensure that we protected the health of our employees and in so doing, secured the health 
of the company. We also recognised that the health of key stakeholders such as contractors and the communities around 
our operations could have a direct impact on the health of our people and the company. Particularly in Zimbabwe and 
Mozambique, our operations are deeply integrated with local communities and many of our employees live in these 
communities. Supporting the health of the people in local communities therefore reduces the risk of infection for our 
people and the resulting risk to the company. 

HEALTHY PEOPLE
Our approach to Healthy People included both proactive 
(preventative measures) and reactive (responses in cases of infection) 
components. These included: 
•  Limiting the number of employees physically present at our 

operations to only those critical to keep operations running and 
restricting personal and work-related travel.

•  Categorising each job in the company by COVID Risk Level (CRL)  

• 

to assess the risk of exposure for every employee. 
Identifying and implementing appropriate interventions based 
on each individual’s CRL, including daily pre-shift screening, work 
environment adaptation such as removal of at risk access control 
systems and insertion of Perspex barriers, and provision of adequate 
risk appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and sanitisers.

•  Capacitating non-essential staff to work from home, including a 

significant investment in IT capabilities to ensure that people could 
continue to engage with others remotely.

•  Prioritising well being through a Certificate of Fitness process that, 
through a medical examination and blood tests, identified specific 
comorbidities and other individual vulnerabilities, such as age 
profile. This established the Vulnerability Status of all employees 
in terms of COVID-19 so that their individual risk could be 
appropriately managed. It also provided support to individuals with 
uncontrolled comorbidities to better manage their conditions and 
improve their overall quality of life. In addition, roles and locations 
within the organisation were changed where necessary,  
to ensure employee safety. 

• 

•  Conducting return-to-work screening following the Christmas 
break where all staff underwent screening and those deemed  
“at risk” were tested.
Identifying where specific Human Capital skills and capacities 
needed to be improved to respond to the ongoing management  
of CRL. This included: 
 – workplace COVID-19 response protocol training;
 – training on antibody, antigen and PCR testing*; and 
 – recruitment of additional medical practitioners, doctors, nurses, 

laboratory scientists and nursing aides. 

•  Capacitating health services to deal with possible 

cases through additional facilities and/or 
equipment, including:
 – developing and equipping seven isolation 

centres at hospitals in Zimbabwe;

 – ensuring availability of oxygen by installing an 
oxygen bulk storage tank and air compressor  
to pipe oxygen to 40 beds at Triangle Hospital 
in Zimbabwe;

 – installing oxygen generators at Xinavane 

(Mozambique) and Hippo Valley (Zimbabwe);

 – donating PPE to community clinics and 

hospitals in Zimbabwe and Mozambique;

 – procuring and donating ancillary equipment, 

including ventilators and monitoring 
equipment (e.g. pulse oximeters) in Zimbabwe 
and Mozambique; 

 – installing PCR testing* infrastructure at  

Triangle Hospital in Zimbabwe. The facility  
is WHO accredited;

 – providing rapid test kits at each work site 
to screen suspected cases and high-risk 
individuals;

 – in-house design and development of  

the Tongaat Hulett Bucket Breathing Aid  
(CPAP Breathing System) to address the 
shortage of ventilators; and

 – in-house development of Tongaat Hulett 

Aerosol Boxes to provide additional protection 
to medical practitioners during assessments 
(based on an existing design).

*  PCR equipment and PCR testing training were only 

provided in Zimbabwe as these facilities and capabilities 
were not available in public health facilities in the region.

24

 

HEALTHY COMPANY
Tongaat Hulett’s BCP successfully ensured 
that our operations could continue to 
function through lockdown despite the 
impact of the pandemic. It included:

•  ensuring the adequacy of critical 
supplies for the various phases of 
lockdown; 

•  critical staff planning to ensure 

business continuity; 

•  succession planning if critical staff  
were incapacitated by the virus; and

•  continuous and transparent 
stakeholder communication.

HEALTHY COMMUNITY
We recognised the need to support Healthy Communities and implemented 
several initiatives including:

•  providing access to COVID-19 testing for members of local communities, 

particularly in Zimbabwe and Mozambique;

•  providing PCR testing* support to government in Zimbabwe, where access 

• 

to PCR testing* was otherwise unavailable in the local area;
improving access to potable water for communities by providing additional 
water storage tanks in villages and schools, as well as developing a new 
water treatment facility at Triangle (Zimbabwe);

•  donations to government to help develop and equip seven isolation centres 

at government hospitals in Zimbabwe;

•  740 000 litres of sanitiser donated: 250 000 to South Africa, 410 000 to 

Zimbabwe and 80 000 to Mozambique, for use in health facilities; 

•  providing PPE to community clinics and hospitals in both Zimbabwe 

and Mozambique;

•  developing and supporting community awareness campaigns, including 

educating people about appropriate interventions; 

•  donating PPE to schools and communities;
•  conducting sanitisation of schools in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and 

South Africa before learners returned to classes, particularly for schools 
where a significant number of COVID-19 cases had been identified;

•  distributing food (nutritional support) in and around Tongaat,  

north of KZN;  

•  partnering with the Red Cross to distribute food parcels in communities 

• 

around all sugar and starch milling operations in South Africa; and
implementing a vaccine roll-out in Zimbabwe, to be rolled-out in both 
Mozambique and South Africa in the 2022 financial year.

Successes and learnings:
•  daily screening for all employees and visitors at all Tongaat Hulett sites was 

implemented before the end of March 2020 and is ongoing;  

•  rapid response to equipment and facility requirements to ensure 

management and treatment of COVID-19 cases;

•  developing and rolling out COVID-19 communication protocols to maximise 

employee, contractor and other stakeholder awareness of the risk, and to 
keep them informed regarding how the company was responding to the 
pandemic;

•  18 857 people tested as part of the certificate of fitness process;
•  all employees screened as part of the return-to-work programme in 

January 2021, with 143 employees identified as COVID-19 positive through 
this process;

•  tragically our business suffered 20 deaths as a consequence of COVID-19 

while 1 049 infections were reported by the business as at 2 May 2021 
resulting in a 0.19% mortality rate since the start of the pandemic; 

•  contact tracing occurred for all positive cases; and 
•  a total investment of R84.21 million was made by the company in COVID-19 
preparedness and response during the financial year ended 31 March 2021.

stakeholders of our commitments, and to measure our performance against 14 of the 17 SDGs where we view an alignment of 
potential impacts.

The SDGs are an effective blueprint to for the global community to achieve a more sustainable future for all persons, regardless of 
gender, race, geographic location and/or historical patterns of SED. They have been designed to address global challenges like human 
suffering, poverty, inequality in income and access to education, healthcare and other related services, climate change and environmental 
degradation, peace and justice. Although an ambitious objective, the overarching objectives is for the SDGs to be achieved by 2030,  
so that all persons – created equally – are to be given access to shared opportunities and basic human rights.

The UN published the 17 SDGs (and 169 SDG-specific targets) in 2015, creating a call to collective action that aims to transform the world 
by 2030. While the focus tends to be on how countries and their governments fare relative to the SDGs, it is important for all governments 
to seek support from the business sector to share in the responsibility of achieving the goals.

The SDGs provide an integrated view of development that is being used to inform implementation of Tongaat Hulett’s inclusive growth 
and development strategy.

Tongaat Hulett’s operations contribute to many of the goals. In some cases, our efforts to help achieve the goals and/or targets are active, in 
that we have specific programmes that are designed, at least in part, to address one or more of the targets. In other cases, our involvement 
can be deemed passive, in that our impact on an SDG and/or a specific target is a matter of happenstance.

In the past year, Tongaat Hulett has worked to strengthen our commitment to the relevant SDGs, with leadership from the Exco assisting 
with efforts to focus more specifically on how Tongaat Hulett does, or can, contribute to global development at a local level.

The following table identifies which goals and targets are relevant in the context of the company, as well as our progress thus far and, 
where available, what specific targets have been set.

committed to contributing 
through the construction and 
capacitation of clinics.

No specific target has been set.

Access to medical facilities and personnel, 
particularly at more remote operations 
where government services are limited, 
seeks to reduce maternal mortality as a 
core component of medical objectives.
Health and medical facilities, particularly 
at more remote locations continue to 
combat infant and child mortality rates, 
particularly from treatable diseases such  
as malnutrition and diarrhoea. 

Clinics and hospitals screen, test, treat and 
seek to prevent diseases among employees 
and community members.
Stakeholder engagement and corporate 
communication efforts regularly include 
matters of health and disease prevention in 
messages to workers and communities.

Target 3.1

Target 3.2

Target 3.3

Target 3.4

Reduce by one-third premature 
mortality from non-communicable 
diseases through prevention and 
treatment and promote mental health 
and well-being. This would include 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes 
or chronic respiratory disease and 
suicide.

In January 2021, more than 18 000 
employees were screened for various 
illnesses within a Certificate of Fitness 
programme linked to the management 
of COVID-19. More than 100 employees 
were identified as at risk health cases to be 
further monitored.

The goal is to ensure that all 
employees in Zimbabwe and 
Mozambique (where local 
health facilities do not exist in 
sufficient capacity) are screened 
for Certificate of Fitness testing 
on an annual basis, with at risk 
cases progressing to regular 
monitoring.

No specific target has been set.

Target 3.5

Strengthen the prevention and 
treatment of substance abuse, including 
narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of 
alcohol.

Target 3.6

Halve (50% less) the number of global 
deaths and injuries from road traffic 
accidents.

Target is to reduce vehicle 
incidents to fewer than  
100 per annum.

All health practitioners, supervisors and 
managerial staff have been duly trained to 
monitor for potential cases of substance 
abuse within the workforce, and cases are 
escalated to doctors for assessment and 
treatment.
Corporate communication efforts regularly 
include the prevention of substance abuse 
in messages to workers and communities.
A spike in vehicle accidents using 
company-owned vehicles, or private 
vehicles on company land occurred 
during the 2020 financial year resulting 
in measures designed to curb traffic 
accidents, particularly in Mozambique, 
where roads are often inadequately 
maintained.
Access to medical facilities and personnel, 
particularly at more remote operations 
where government services are limited, 
seeks to improve access to sexual and 
reproductive healthcare services for 
employees, their families and  
community members.

Target 3.7

Ensure universal access to sexual and 
reproductive healthcare services, 
including for family planning, 
information and education, and the 
integration of reproductive health into 
national strategies and programmes.

As per above, the company invests heavily 
in Human Capital development, at least 
in part to ensure sustainability of future 
leaders for internal promotion.
This is of critical importance in 
Mozambique, where access to skills 
development training is lower than in 
Zimbabwe or South Africa.
Enterprise Development (ED) in support of 
entrepreneurs is another way in which skills 
and capacity are enhanced.
R35.7 million spent on ED.
Training and development opportunities 
are often allocated specifically to women, 
persons with disabilities and previously 
disadvantaged individuals to correct 
historical norms.

ecosystems, including mountains, forests, 
wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes.

Environmental Impact Assesments (EIAs) are 
conducted prior to any significant changes 
to land use or facility construction. These are 
approved by government authorities and 
form the basis for the implementation of 
water management plans.
Tongaat Hulett Developments is equally 
responsible for EIAs and when properties  
are developed for construction.

OUR APPROACH02Target 8.1

PROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE  
ECONOMIC GROWTH, FULL AND PRODUCTIVE  
EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL
Sustain per capita economic growth in 
accordance with national circumstances 
and, in particular, at least 7% gross domestic 
product growth per annum in the least 
developed countries.

Target 8.2

Achieve higher levels of economic 
productivity through diversification, 
technological upgrading and innovation, 
including through a focus on high-value 
added and labour-intensive sectors.

Target 8.3

Promote development-oriented policies 
that support productive activities,  
decent job creation, entrepreneurship, 
creativity and innovation.

Target 8.4

Improve progressively, through 2030,  
global resource efficiency in consumption 
and production and endeavour to decouple 
economic growth from environmental 
degradation, in accordance with the 10 Year 
Framework of Programmes on Sustainable 
Consumption and Production, with 
developed countries taking the lead.

PROGRESS TO DATE

TARGETS

Within the context of Tongaat Hulett, our 
ability to influence per capita income 
growth extends to our employees and 
contractors.

Following a period of significant 
restructuring, the company’s overall 
employee turnover was decreased to 3.8% 
– mostly due to the sale of operations, and 
not necessarily retrenchments – while the 
income of all employees and contractors 
either remained steady or slightly 
increased.
Tongaat Hulett generated income through 
the milling of sugarcane to produce sugar 
(raw and refined) and related products, as 
well as ethanol and animal feeds. Future 
planning focuses on high return products 
that tend to rely on greater levels of 
primary product beneficiation.
The training and in situ workplace 
development of artisans and graduates 
is strategically geared towards improving 
economic opportunities for persons within 
the communities we operate. This includes 
within our workforce (direct impact), 
our supply chain (indirect) and through 
our many socioeconomic development 
initiatives. 
All activities are measured in terms of 
both negative and positive impacts on 
the physical/natural environment in which 
Tongaat Hulett operates.

Our key focus areas for improved 
efficiencies are energy, carbon, water and 
waste, such that economic performance 
cannot exist at the expense of 
environmental degradation.

No specific targets have 
been set, but our ultimate 
goal is to increase per capita 
income across all of our 
operations through wage 
increases based on economic 
conditions and operational 
performance.

Targets will be made available 
at the appropriate time.

No specific targets have  
been set.

Short-term targets have 
been set to improve all 
environmental efficiencies  
by a minimum of 5% against 
an updated 2021 baseline  
by 2025.

Additional targets (e.g., 
“Net Zero by 2050”) will be 
assessed and discussed once 
improved ESG data collection, 
collation and reporting 
systems and controls 
allow for scientific and/or 
mathematical modelling 
against new baselines.

32

Target 8.5

PROMOTE SUSTAINED, INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE  
ECONOMIC GROWTH, FULL AND PRODUCTIVE 
EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL
Achieve full and productive employment 
and decent work for all women and men, 
including for young people and persons 
with disabilities, and equal pay for work of 
equal value.

Target 8.6

Substantially reduce the proportion of youth 
not in employment, education or training.

Target 8.7

Target 8.8

Take immediate and effective measures 
to eradicate forced labour, end modern 
slavery and human trafficking and secure 
the prohibition and elimination of the worst 
forms of child labour, including recruitment 
and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end 
child labour in all its forms.
Protect labour rights and promote safe and 
secure working environments for all workers, 
including migrant workers, in particular 
women migrants, and those in precarious 
employment.

PROGRESS TO DATE

TARGETS

As Tongaat Hulett’s 
operations have become 
normalised following a 
series of asset sales, new 
programmes are being 
implemented to improve the 
representation of women, 
youth and persons with 
disabilities.

New systems and controls 
are being developed to 
allow for the reporting of age 
distribution, as well as the 
setting of relevant targets.
Tongaat Hulett has a Zero 
Tolerance policy for any/all 
forms of human rights abuse, 
including forced, compulsory 
and/or child labour.

No specific targets have  
been set.

However, the action plans 
for improving migrant 
worker living conditions will 
be audited during FY2022 
to ensure full compliance 
to all agreed upon 
recommendations.

Although still relatively low, female 
representation across the entire company 
improved from 17.9% in FY2020 to 20.6% 
in FY2021. 

The representation of persons with 
disabilities within the workforce is an area 
of continued concern, such that fewer than 
0.2% of employees were deemed “disabled” 
according to government guidance in 
FY2021.

Tongaat Hulett does not discriminate 
economically, or in any manner, based on 
race, gender or degrees of physical ability. 
Salaries and wages are set by job profile, 
and variations are limited to levels of 
experience, skills and/or education levels.
Policies to assist unemployed youth exist, 
but current reporting does not include a 
breakdown by age category.

The absolute restriction of all forms of 
human rights abuse are embedded in 
our Code of Ethics and Human Rights 
policies, as well as service agreements 
with contractors and supplier by means of 
adherence to these policies.

Tongaat Hulett is specifically exposed 
to challenges migrant workers face, 
particularly seasonal employees.

Human Capital policies focus beyond 
permanent staff, being mindful of unique 
needs of seasonal workers (e.g. access 
to medical care, housing, and skills 
development opportunities).

During FY2021, migrant worker living 
conditions in Mozambique were identified 
as an opportunity for improvement 
during a customer-related audit. 
Recommendations from their audit were 
converted to action plans to improve 
housing, sanitation and access to water. 
Completion of the plans is expected to 
occur in FY2022.

AND SUSTAINABLE
Ensure access for all to adequate, safe 
and affordable housing and basic 
services and upgrade slums.

PROGRESS TO DATE

TARGETS

Wage increases, particularly for  
workers at lower skill levels, are always 
targeted above inflation to ensure that  
“real income” does not decrease relative 
to country-specific consumer pricing 
indexes.
The promotion of social, economic 
and political inclusion of all persons, 
regardless of age, sex, disability, race, 
ethnicity, origin, religion or economic 
or other status is entrenched within  
our Code of Ethics and Human Rights 
policies, as well as service agreements 
with contractors and supplier by 
means of adherence to these policies.

All forms of discrimination are explicitly 
restricted from all activities and/or 
operations via the same set of policies.
All Human Capital policies related to 
the recruitment, retention  
and/or development of employees are 
structured to create greater equality 
within the workforce.

Targets exist to ensure that wages, 
particularly at lower Living Standards 
Measure (LSM) levels, at or above 
national averages, while increases 
remain above inflation to ensure real 
income growth.
In line with the dti Codes of Good 
Practice for B-BBEEE in South Africa, 
specific targets are set to ensure no 
less than compliance with national 
targets for the inclusion of previously 
disadvantaged individuals, women, 
and persons with disabilities. 

Tongaat Hulett has a specific Zero 
Tolerance policy for all forms of 
discrimination by all employees, 
contractors and/or suppliers.

Specific targets are set in accordance 
with the dti* Codes of Good Practice  
for B-BBEEE in South Africa, and related 
legislation in all other countries of 
operation.

No specific targets have been set, but 
all operations are expected to review 
company-supplied and/or supported 
housing no less than annually. 

Stakeholder engagement planning 
includes the communities around 
operations to establish specific 
concerns and/or ways in which 
Tongaat Hulett can help improve 
living conditions (e.g., supporting 
infrastructure development and/or 
provision of specific services within 
local municipal governments). 
All legal and regulatory compliance 
audits are planned on a rotating  
two-year cycle.

Wherever possible (i.e., within the 
control of Tongaat Hulett), the living 
conditions of all employees, inclusive 
of migrant seasonal workers, are 
assessed to ensure safe, affordable 
and environmentally sustainable 
opportunities, particularly at operations 
where operation-specific communities 
have been developed to meet the 
specific needs of the company.  

The development and/or expansion 
of all operational activities occurs in 
the presence of impact assessments 
for environmental, social, cultural and 
archaeological considerations. 

Regularly scheduled legal and 
regulatory compliance audits occur to 
ensure no negative impacts on cultural 
and/or natural heritage occur.

Target 11.4

Strengthen efforts to protect and 
safeguard the world’s cultural and 
natural heritage.

element within the communities 
established for the specific needs of 
Tongaat Hulett operations.

Target 12.2 Achieve the sustainable management 
and efficient use of natural resources.

Target 12.4 Achieve the environmentally sound 

management of chemicals and all 
wastes throughout their life cycle, in 
accordance with agreed international 
frameworks, and significantly reduce 
their release to air, water and soil 
in order to minimize their adverse 
impacts on human health and the 
environment.
Substantially reduce waste generation 
through prevention, reduction, 
recycling and reuse.

Encourage companies, especially large 
and transnational companies, to adopt 
sustainable practices and to integrate 
sustainability information into their 
reporting cycle.

Target 12.5

Target 12.6

The use of natural resources, such 
as land, water, forests – both for 
operational and non-operational 
purposes (e.g., within company-
established communities) occurs 
within a mindset of ensuring that these 
resources remain sustainable during 
and/or after company use.
The management of all forms of waste, 
including hazardous chemicals, is 
duly entrenched in the environmental 
management plans of all operations.

Legal and regulatory compliance audits 
(internal and/or external) are in place to 
avoid any/all negative consequences.

97.7% of all non-hazardous waste was 
recycled in FY2021 (up from 97.6% in 
FY2020).

Through the engagement of all 
contractors, suppliers and peers 
within local and/or national industry 
bodies, Tongaat Hulett encourages 
share sustainability improvements. 
This includes specific expectations of 
compliance to all company policies 
and procedures by suppliers and 
contractors via service agreements.

While risk management is an ongoing 
process throughout the company, the 
re-mapping of all risks occurs on at 
least an annual basis at all operations.

No specific targets have been set.

Specific efficiency targets have been 
set for water, energy, carbon emissions 
and waste disposal.

All short-term targets are currently set 
at achieving a 5% improvement by 
2025 based on a new 2021 baseline.

A Responsible Agri-Chemicals Use 
Policy is under development to  
further enhance the measurement, 
monitoring and impact evaluation of 
all fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides 
 and/or ripeners. This policy is expected 
to be completed and adopted within 
FY2022.

While a 5% improvement in waste 
efficiency is targeted for 2025, the 
ultimate goal is to achieve “Zero Waste 
to Landfill” at all operations.
Future amendments to supply 
agreements with contractors and 
suppliers that are being considered 
are expected to include improved 
reference to the seeking of efficiency 
improvements that may impact 
Tongaat Hulett either directly and/or 
indirectly (e.g. water consumption by 
small scale and/or large commercial 
cane farmers).
Improved sustainability dialogue is 
being developed first through the 
publication of bi-monthly company 
newsletters and via an internal network 
of TV screens. Content is expected 
to be developed based on group 
engagement with employees within 
the company’s operations.

Target 12.8

Ensure that people everywhere 
have the relevant information and 
awareness for sustainable development 
and lifestyles in harmony with nature

Historical promotion of sustainable 
living initiatives has been limited 
almost exclusively to information 
contained within the annual 
Sustainability Report.

natural disasters in all countries.

As of FY2021, the identification and 
prioritization of climate-related risks, 
as well as reporting on these risks in 
accordance with guidance established 
by the TCFD, now occurs on no less 
than an annual basis to ensure that the 
mitigation of priority risks occurs in a 
proactive manner.
As from FY2021, climate-related risks 
now form part of the annual risk 
management process.
FY2021 represented a key fact-finding 
year for Tongaat Hulett, culminating in 
the development of the company’s  
first annual ESG and Climate Change 
Report.

As from FY2022, improved reporting 
on specific projects designed to either 
directly or indirectly influence climate 
change preparedness will occur 
through increased dialogue with the 
operations.

No specific targets have been set.

Climate change awareness campaigns 
will be included in internal and external 
communications ad from FY2022, 
specific training of key personnel will 
be rolled out at all operations.

impacts on the sustainable use of land, 
water and air.

Reforestation is an alternative that is 
currently being considered for future 
carbon offset programmes, inclusive of 
potential company and/or third-party 
use of company owned available land.

A Biodiversity Policy is to be developed 
in FY2022 as well as site-specific 
Biodiversity Action Plans.

While aiding in the protection of 
forests – particularly for the harvesting 
of firewood by residents in and around 
operation-specific communities –  
is a key stakeholder engagement issue, 
no current programmes are in place to 
significantly impact forest sustainability. 
However, reforestation is viewed as a 
key potential programme to help offset 
future carbon emissions.
The monitoring and management land 
deemed “non-viable” for sugarcane 
growing is an ongoing issue within 
Tongaat Hulett.

Environmental impact assessments 
and management plans are in place 
at all operations to ensure minimal

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTOUR APPROACH02UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT  
COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS FOR 2021

Tongaat Hulett is committed to supporting the  
UNGC and participating in all associated initiatives.  
The company uses guidance from the UNGC to inform 
internal and external stakeholders of our commitments, 
and to measure our performance against all of the  
10 principles. 

Gavin Hudson

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Following a self-assessment to identify the extent to which the 10 UNGC 
principles are embedded at both the group and operation-specific levels, 
coupled with engagement with the UNGC global office, and the South African 
UNGC office, the Tongaat Hulett Board reaffirmed its commitment to the UNGC  
in November of 2020.

The primary goal of becoming a signatory to the UNGC has always been to 
ensure alignment to global best practice with respect to human rights, the fair 
and equitable treatment of employees (labour), protection and appropriate use 
of the natural environment, and the avoidance of all forms of corruption.

It is believed that by engaging with the UNGC local and/or global offices, 
including participation in discussion groups, webinars, conferences and other 
forums, Tongaat Hulett will be able to identify areas of specific non-compliance, 
while seeking guidance on how to most effectively close any performance gaps.

We believe that this ESG and Climate Change Report serves as an effective UNGC 
communication of progress (CoP), coupled with the following summary of our 
commitment to each principle.

RESPONSE
The protection and promotion of human rights has been a significant focus area within all 
areas of our business. Respect for human rights is embodied in our Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics, and is being reinforced through the development and implementation of our 
Human Rights policy.
The avoidance of human rights abuses within the company, inclusive of our workforce, supply 
chain and strategic partnerships is rooted in the expectation that our stakeholders will be 
aware of what constitutes an abuse, how to report potential incidents, and how the company 
deals with any real or perceived abuses from a moral, legal and ethical manner. 
All employees and contractors are provided a safe, secure and healthy work environment 
where workers are protected from all forms of harassment and/or abuse.
Where deemed necessary, appropriate steps are taken to identify health and safety hazards, 
including any form of exposure to heat stress, exposure to chemicals and/or the potential for 
injury from vehicles or machinery.

All employees, including those of our contractors are subject to their legal right to join a union 
and participate in collective bargaining.

Tongaat Hulett policies prohibit all forms of forced, compulsory and/or indentured labour 
within our workforce, as well as among our suppliers and contractors.
While Tongaat Hulett identifies the difference between ”Child Work” and “Child Labour”,  
our HR and Recruitment policies ensure that no persons under the age of 18  
are permitted to be employed within the company.
Our Human Rights policy explicitly forbids all forms of discrimination, including the selection  
or rejection of persons for employment based on gender, race, religion and/or disability.

Tongaat Hulett does not permit any form of forced or bonded labour within our workforce or 
that of our suppliers and contractors.
All employees are guaranteed wages that meet or exceed minimum wage standards in all 
countries in which we operate, and explicitly insist the same of our suppliers and contractors.
Work schedules are generally limited to 48 hours per week, while exceptional cases, such as for 
security guards, may allow for government mandated maximums of up to 72 hours.

Tongaat Hulett is committed to ensuring that all environmental, health and safety challenges 
are proactively identified on a risk-related basis, inclusive of near misses and high frequency 
risk incidents (HRFIs).
The goal is to ensure that threats of serious harm to persons, or damage to the environment, 
must be addressed in a manner that favours the prevention of the said risk.
Efficiency targets for environmental performance are set to minimise damage wherever 
possible. This includes the setting of targets for “Zero Waste to Landfill”, the improvement of 
water, energy and carbon efficiencies, and the encouragement of operations to strive towards 
water neutrality at sugar mills, and “Net Zero” targets for carbon emissions.
Ongoing monitoring of water efficiencies at the agricultural, milling and refining has led to  
the development of plans to, for example, move away from furrow irrigation to drip and/or  
centre-pivot technology.
Smart irrigation technology is planned for future developments, with a reasonable expectation 
of reducing irrigation water consumption by up to 40%.
The installation and/or upgrading of scrubbers on mill and refinery stacks is planned in pursuit 
of further improvements in future air emissions.
Policies and procedures to manage environmental legal and regulatory compliance  
have been significantly improved in FY2021, inclusive of the full-time appointment of a  
group Environmental Compliance Officer.

N 10.  Businesses should work against 

corruption in all its forms, 
including extortion  
and bribery.

Over the year, Tongaat Hulett has significantly improved its Fraud and Corruption policies 
and procedures in an attempt to eliminate, wherever possible, the potential for bribery and 
corruption in all forms. This includes the improvement of procedures to inform and instruct 
employees, suppliers and contractors of the risks associated with corruption, as well as the 
methods employed to report potential incidents for investigation.

The activities of the HR function are guided by the new Human 
Captial Purpose Statement. The function has embarked on a 
transformation initiative to evolve the Human Capital strategy, 
practices and policies from a transactional function to a value-
adding function that is a critical enabler to maximising Tongaat 
Hulett’s potential and performance. The capability plan to support 
this transition has been defined and has begun.

A Human Capital executive team has been established to lead the 
thinking and problem-solving regarding Human Capital in the 
company. In addition, we have formed Communities of Practice 
(CoPs) that work closely with the HR executive to refine and focus 
Human Capital initiatives. These CoPs enable capability building 
and alignment of practices across the organisation. Their mandate 
is to identify problems and opportunities to improve our practices, 
identify best practice within the organisation and to standardise 
this across the organisation, and to identify and integrate external 
best practice into the organisation where no internal solutions 
exist. The CoPs play a critical change agent role for the enterprise. 

The Human Capital Strategy identifies the priority business 
processes necessary to achieve the company’s financial goals, 
meet the expectations of its key stakeholders and sustain  
Tongaat Hulett’s ability to change and improve. The objectives 
to move the organisation to the desired future state have been 
mapped to key performance measures and targets for the 
next three years. The People Management Way identifies the 
deliverables required to attract, develop, engage and reward 
employees while putting in place the framework to help  
them succeed. 

HUMAN CAPITAL IN 2021
Protecting the health and well-being of our employees was a core 
focus of Tongaat Hulett’s response to COVID-19, in recognition 
that a healthy business is not possible without healthy people 
(see page 24 for more information on the company’s COVID-19 
response). 

Leave management is being converted to an active system to 
proactively manage against the impacts of burnout and fatigue 
by identifying people who are due leave and encouraging them 
to take it. 

EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT 
The Ipsos survey conducted in the first quarter of 2021 showed 
that employee engagement improved from 67 (average) in the 
previous survey in the first quarter of 2020 to 71 (good), with 78% 
of employees surveyed likely or extremely likely to recommend 
the company as a place to work. It also showed that employees 
feel communication continues to improve under the new 
leadership. We aim to build on these strengths while addressing 
the areas of improvement identified in the survey, which include:

1. Resolving issues quickly and effectively;
2. Training and development of employees;
3. Transparent communication;
4. Communicating Tongaat Hulett’s promising future; and
5. Demonstrating the company’s ability to create long-term 

shareholder value.
  More information on the survey is available on page 63.

SKILLS
The restructuring and rightsizing of the company is ongoing. 
Retrenchments and voluntary severance packages completed in 
the 2021 financial year related to those initiated in the prior year. 
All organisational structures and senior roles across our operations 
were reviewed with the goal of creating fit for purpose structures 
with the right people in the right positions with the right skill set. 

The organisation continues to evolve through defining what 
capabilities are required to achieve operational excellence and 
the implementation of our strategy. Against this, we are defining 
and implementing fit for purpose structures. Our current focus is 
on retaining jobs as far as possible and building capacity where 
necessary, while ensuring the financial viability of the business.

The sale of the Eswatini, Namibia and starch businesses also 
led to a reduction of employee headcount, number of training 
programmes, and employee skills composition.

A talent review was conducted to develop a People Balance 
Sheet that identified the capabilities required to drive operational 
excellence and profitability, and to support the sustainability of 
the company.

These needs have informed our 2022 change management 
plans, learning and development plans and related budgets, 
talent attraction plans to address critical skills gaps, key employee 
retention plans, and high-potential employee development plans 
to improve our succession planning and strengthen our bench 
strength. We aspire to deploy talent across the region between 
our operations to enhance our capabilities within  
each organisation. 

CULTURE
Various initiatives are being implemented to continue the 
transformation of the organisational culture. Tongaat Hulett’s  
new set of values and desired behaviours were rolled out during 
the year and are being entrenched across the business. As part  
of the culture change programme, we are running a  
“Values Pioneers” campaign in which employees are invited  
to nominate a colleague who lives the Tongaat Hulett values for 
recognition and a chance to be in the running to win the overall 
2021 Values Pioneer award. 

The current focus is on creating the foundation required to  
create values-based leadership and a high-performance culture. 
The next step is to build capabilities within the company’s leaders 
so that they can implement business and culture transformation 
initiatives in their areas of responsibility. 

Maintaining high levels of internal communication and staff 
engagement were an ongoing priority during the year, particularly 
regarding the company’s response to COVID-19. 

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
Tongaat Hulett’s Success Management programme aims to 
manage the performance of teams and individuals against goals 
through clear and personal accountability. This ensures the 
execution of our business strategy, builds sustainable business 
performance, and shapes a culture of high performance and high 
engagement. Remuneration structures were redesigned in the 
prior financial year to re-energise performance management and 
support strategic delivery. 
COMPONENTS OF THE SUCCESS MANAGEMENT 
PROGRAMME
Values and competencies have been mapped against team 
members and team leaders from middle management and above. 
Self-management practices have been created for each value for 
all employees and line managers, and these have been included 
in the 360-degree feedback assessments introduced during the 
year. Performance reviews were conducted during the year and 
the process included calibration to reduce line manager bias, and 
to ensure transparency and consistency across the organisation. 
Employee turnover has increased as a result of the introduction of 
performance management although this is expected to stabilise 
once the process is embedded.

Training and development initiatives were affected by COVID-19 
and the immediate focus on performance improvement across 
the company. Training programmes delivered during the year 
reduced to 11 223 in 2021 from 11 988 the previous year and 
training spend decreased to R23.8 million from R34.8 million.

Occupational-based learning at our South African operations is 
required to be mandated by the Quality, Trades and Council of 
Occupations (QTCOs), a body that oversees occupational learning 
as per the Skills Development Act of 1998. Most training relates to 
safety and compliance, and operations and core functional skills. 

During the year, a Talent Management framework was 
implemented for all senior management employees to identify 
employees with critical skills and put in place individual 
development plans to provide the current and future skills 
required for the company’s sustainability and to support 
succession planning. Training is provided through a blended 
learning approach that combines formal training (i.e. off-site 
education), coaching and mentorship, and on-the-job training. 

Online training on the Success Management programme was 
provided as part of the rollout of this initiative. At management 
level, the training focus for the 2021 financial year was on 
governance and risk, covering topics such as competition law as 
well as environmental, social and governance issues. In the year 
ahead, management training will cover commercial acumen,  
and leadership and management development.

The engineers in training programmes and internships continued 
during the year. While the number of candidates on the graduate 
development programme reduced this year, we are very pleased 
with the absorption rate, with all candidates at our Zimbabwean 
operations being absorbed.  At our South African operation, three 
engineers in training are still in the programme, two left and one 
was absorbed during the year. Nine of the 28 apprentices that 
qualified during the year in South Africa were employed into the 
operation with a further nine still in training. In Mozambique,  
four candidates are currently on the engineer in training 
programme and the contracts for the 19 apprentices in the 
operation were extended due to COVID-19, with provision made 
to absorb all 19 on completion of their contracts. 

The new Tongaat Hulett Management Development Programme 
was launched in December 2020. The 18-month programme is 
run by Duke Corporate Education, one of the global leaders in 
Corporate Education programmes, and includes a combination 
of contact learning days, self-paced learning, team and individual 
business impact projects and a community project. Learning 
occurs virtually, connecting talent from our operations across  
all countries with some of Duke’s best faculty members.  
The goal of the programme is to ensure that theory is grounded 
in operational opportunity and challenges. Learners are 
expected to apply the theoretical knowledge gained to practical 
applications in their specific activities and roles. The management 
development programme is an important aspect of our talent 
management framework that aims to accelerate pipeline 
development and succession.

BENEFITS

Remuneration and benefits are important 
components of Tongaat Hulett’s employee 
value proposition. Benefits available to 
employees in our merit-based packages 
include on-site clinic facilities, medical aid, 
retirement funding, death and disability 
benefits, guaranteed bonuses or long-
term and short-term incentives such as 
performance related bonuses  
and shares.

The focus in 2021 was to understand the 
benefits offering by country and quantify 
the monetary value of each benefit at an 
employee level. In parallel, opportunities 
were identified on benefit offerings  
that were not competitive against the  
general market in each country.  
The opportunities were prioritised into key 
projects based on their current and future 
impact on employee attraction, retention, 
engagement, and wealth creation.  
In 2022 recommendations will be made 
on each key project to enable decision  
making on how we can regain market 
competitiveness on the identified 
opportunities. The ultimate vision is 
to offer each employee flexibility and 
choice on their preferred benefits based 
on their life stage, status personal value 
propositions and affordability.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTHUMAN CAPITAL03ETHICS

The Tongaat Hulett Board is committed to leading the 
organisation ethically and effectively, and to ensuring that the 
ethics of the organisation are governed in a way that supports 
the establishment of an ethical culture. The Code of Conduct and 
Business Ethics (the Code) sets out the company’s commitment 
to ethical leadership, fair dealing and integrity in the conduct of 
their business, based on our fundamental belief that business 
should be conducted honestly, fairly and legally. Governance 
processes and policies have been strengthened to ensure that the 
company’s behaviours are aligned with the Code and the group 
has been capacitated with a particular focus on governance  
and compliance. 

The Code sets out the company’s ethical position and its 
expectations of employees and other stakeholders across 
a range of areas. This includes regulatory compliance, the 
company’s policy on human rights, principles of ethical business 
practice, conflicts of interest which includes a gifts policy and 
managing relationships with stakeholders (including a supplier 
code of conduct), anti-competitive behaviour, whistle-blowing 
mechanisms, the company’s stance against the intimidation/
victimisation of whistle-blowers, anti-corruption policies,  
and SHE responsibility.

Compliance with the Code is mandatory for all employees and 
stakeholders, and applies to service providers, suppliers, and 
other representatives of the company across all operations and 
geographic areas.

If employees become aware of, or suspect, a contravention of the 
Code, they must promptly and confidentially report the matter 
to their line manager, HR, to the executive responsible for the 
operation concerned, or to the Company Secretary.  
An anonymous 24/7 independent whistle-blower hotline is also 
available for employees and other stakeholders to confidentially 
report suspected unethical behaviour through an email,  
website or free-call numbers in South Africa, Zimbabwe, 
Mozambique and Botswana. These are available on our website  
at www.tongaat.com/governance-and-sustainability/tip-offs  
and in the Code, which can be downloaded from  
www.tongaat.com/governance-and-sustainability/governance 

Tip-offs received through the hotline are investigated and 
reported to the Social and Ethics Committee, who receive reports 

  
  

on unethical conduct together with the investigations undertaken 
and action taken against employees at every meeting. Where 
behaviour is discovered to be in contravention of the Code, 
employees face the appropriate sanctions, which could include 
dismissal and, in some cases, civil and criminal prosecutions.

A total of 64 reports were received during the period 1 April 2020 
to 31 March 2021. During the previous year a total of 67 tip-off 
reports were received. The prior year statistics includes seven 
reports that were received for the starch business, which was sold 
during the year. The whistle-blowing reports received have been 
classified into eight categories as detailed in the graph below:

DISCIPLINARY AND  
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
Every employee is expected to carry out 
their duties and conduct themselves 
in a responsible manner according to 
acceptable norms and legal requirements. 
Tongaat Hulett’s disciplinary code makes 
provision for correcting behaviour and 
was created to apply discipline in a 
just, equitable and uniform manner, 
maintaining employee dignity and 
human rights. We have standardised our 
offences and sanctions, where possible 
across the group. In line with our success 
management philosophy, we believe in 
progressive discipline. Each case is treated 
on its own merits, discretion is exercised 
and consistency is maintained.

Established grievance procedures are in 
place, many of which have been agreed 
with recognised unions, that provide for 
a defined process to resolve individual 
employee’s grievances arising out of 
their employment. We aim to resolve 
grievances within a reasonable time 
frame and as close to the point of origin 
as possible.

ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
Tongaat Hulett takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud, theft and other forms of 
economic crime such as corruption, bribery and money laundering. The Code articulates 
our commitment to detecting, preventing and combating any such crimes that may affect 
our business. Legal proceedings are instituted against perpetrators on a consistent basis.
The company’s Fraud Risk Management Strategy is supported by numerous policies 
that aim to address the business’s approach to dealing with the risk of fraud from the 
perspectives of prevention, detection, response and resolution.

FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
Tongaat Hulett recognises employees’rights to freedom of association and  
collective bargaining, both of which are fundamental principles of human rights.  
A total of 16 404 (2020: 20 320) manufacturing and agricultural operations’ employees 
form part of collective bargaining agreements with the unions listed below. There was  
no strike action during the year and no days were lost to industrial action during the year  
(2020: no strikes and 0 days lost).
We aim to give employees appropriate notice prior to implementing significant 
operational changes that could substantially affect them, ranging from four to 12 weeks 
depending on their country of employment. The notice period is specified in some of the 
collective bargaining agreements in place.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTHUMAN CAPITAL03HEALTH AND SAFETY

Our employees are key drivers in Tongaat Hulett’s strategy to secure the long-term sustainability of the company. We are committed to 
ensuring a safe work environment and we strive to ensure that all employees are in the best possible health to carry out their duties.  
“Safely home every day” is one of our core values. 

Occupational health and safety systems at all operations were historically aligned with and certified in terms of the NOSA 5 Star system,  
but these certifications were discontinued in 2018 due to cost constraints. In line with our core values, management has decided that 
SHE systems will be reinstated in our SHE programmes with a view to implementing ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety) and  
ISO 14001 (Environmental Management). The legacy operational procedures in place aligned to the NOSA system will be adapted, 
improved and incorporated into the relevant clauses of the ISO 45001 system. Targeted awareness training is planned from April 2021  
as the next step in implementing these systems. SANS 16001 (Wellness and Disease Management System), has been implemented at 
Hippo Valley Estates, Voermol Feeds® and Maidstone Sugar Mill.

SAFETY
The safety of our employees is a top priority. Safety systems and 
protocols are in place to mitigate the risk of harmful workplace 
exposures, incidents and injuries. Enforcing safe working practices 
by employees, contractors and suppliers receives ongoing and 
continuous attention. 

Our approach to safety has moved beyond a mechanistic and 
systems-driven framework to a focus on entrenching a culture of 
safety that influences behaviour change and enforces compliance. 
The approach centres around six key focus areas that aim to 
ensure the safety and health of our people while also caring for 
the environment within our stakeholder community. Risk control 
measures for Tongaat Hulett’s top five safety risks have been 
identified and controls implemented to mitigate against these 
risks. These risks and controls are monitored at the highest level  
of the organisation.

It is with sadness that we report a total of 20 deaths during the 
reporting period, comprising one work-related fatality,  
seven non-work related and 12 third-party incidents. The loss of 
life is deeply concerning and the company remains committed to 
investigating effective ways to prevent this from happening.

FATALITIES
Work-related fatalities
Any work-related death resulting directly from an occupational incident.
Non-work related deaths
Death to a Tongaat Hulett employee or contractor arising out of an activity or incident that is not 
related to the affected person’s line of duty. In 2021 these deaths were largely due to ill health.
Third-party deaths
Death to a person who is not an employee or contractor of Tongaat Hulett but affecting  
Tongaat Hulett in some way. This incident could arise out of an activity or incident involving  
Tongaat Hulett employees, equipment or operations. In 2021 these deaths were largely  
caused by poaching on company property.

HEALTH
We value the contribution made by our 
employees and the company works with 
them to invest in their health and well-being. 
Employees can access primary healthcare 
services at on-site clinic facilities and the 
company supports and manages primary 
healthcare clinics and hospitals, mainly in 
Mozambique and Zimbabwe, which benefit 
employees and their dependants.

COVID-19
Tongaat Hulett’s three-pronged response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic emphasised 
the importance of Healthy People and we 
implemented a range of proactive and reactive 
initiatives to safeguard the health of employees. 
This included limiting exposure through social 
distancing and remote working, implementing 
physical controls, awareness and training, and 
taking a risk-based and individualised approach 
to ensuring the health of every employee. While 
we are proud of the extensive controls and 
protocols, we put in place to ensure Healthy 
People, Healthy Communities and a Healthy 
Company (see page 24), we are saddened to 
report 20 employee deaths due to COVID-19 in 
the period ending 25 June 2021.

HIV/AIDS AND TB MANAGEMENT
We recognise HIV/AIDS as a significant  
business risk and the company aligns with 
the UN AIDS 90-90-90 target for the global 
community. The target aims to ensure 90% 
awareness of HIV status, 90% access to 
antiretrovirals (ARVs) for HIV positive people and 
90% of those on treatment achieving  
viral suppression.

A comprehensive programme to manage HIV/AIDS is in place 
that includes voluntary HIV counselling and testing services that 
are available to all employees at all operations, either internally or 
through service providers. Employees testing positive commence  
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and are monitored to ensure adequate 
viral suppression.

Not all operations managed to achieve all the UN AIDS targets in 
the past year. One of the key setbacks was the COVID-19 pandemic 
which derailed completion of some wellness programmes, 
especially in Mozambique and Zimbabwe. 

Overall awareness of HIV status was 42% against the target of 90%. 
Of eligible employees, 98% are on ART, with 74% of these being 
well controlled.

The number of employees on company-sponsored ART in  
South Africa continues to decrease as availability of ART at state 
facilities- increases and employees move from company-funded  
to state-funded programmes, where these are available.

We continue to work with our partners to address the challenge  
of HIV/AIDS and drive towards achieving global goals, such as the 
UN AIDS targets to 2025.

HEALTH AND SAFETY CONTINUED

MALARIA
Malaria is endemic in large parts of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and poses a 
significant health risk to employees and dependants. Comprehensive malaria 
prevention, detection and treatment programmes are in place in affected areas 
in the form of integrated malaria control programmes that include vector control, 
awareness, personal protection, diagnosis and treatment. Tongaat Hulett participates 
in malaria private-public partnerships in both Mozambique and Zimbabwe to 
strengthen the response to malaria for the benefit of employees and communities. 

In 2021, malaria cases decreased to 1 237.

WELLNESS MANAGEMENT
Unfavourable lifestyle factors can impact an employees’ wellness, fitness for work 
and productivity, and contribute to the burden of non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, lung diseases, arthritis and mental 
illness. The high prevalence of NCDs in developing markets imposes significant 
social and economic costs on these countries. 

Tongaat Hulett is actively engaging with employees to build understanding and 
help them address NCDs. Wellness and disease management systems aligned  
with SANS 16001 were successfully implemented at Hippo Valley Estates,  
Voermol Feeds and Maidstone Sugar Mill, and the learnings from this process 
informed the wellness programme rolled out across the company operations.  
NCD prevention and control is currently focused on targeting specific risk factors, 
as well as social and environmental determinants through information provided by 
health promotion initiatives and primary healthcare services.

OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RISK MANAGEMENT
The nature of our operations and the heavy plant and machinery used expose 
employees to workplace hazards and risks that include musculoskeletal disorders 
arising from manual handling, heavy physical work, frequent bending, twisting and 
lifting, and repetitive work.

Tongaat Hulett’s occupational health programme aims to reduce the potential 
for exposure to health risks through early identification of those at risk and the 
implementation of precautionary measures, including PPE, where relevant. 
Employees working in areas of high noise are issued with customised hearing 
protection devices that have a higher noise attenuation factor to significantly reduce 
the impact of noise on their hearing.

There were no occupational health-related fatalities, nor any occupational health 
cases with irreversible health effects in 2021 or 2020. 

Botswana continues to be plagued by tenosynovitis cases that are related 
to repetitive strain injuries among sugar packers. Management is working to 
prevent similar cases through close monitoring of staff rotation and designing an 
appropriate supporting base to minimise weight exerted on the wrist at the time of 
filling the sugar bags. A total of 11 reversible cases of tenosynovitis were recorded in 
Botswana for the year, compared with 57 in 2020.

Innovation in the fight against COVID-19
Many people hospitalised with COVID-19 need breathing support and at the 
start of the pandemic there was a global shortage of ventilators as patient 
numbers spiked. These devices are also very expensive and very few were 
available in Tongaat Hulett’s countries of operation, particularly Zimbabwe 
and Mozambique.
In response, a Tongaat Hulett team, led by Dr Craig Jensen (Genaral Manager – Refinery) and 
Dr Tongai Mukwewa (Tongaat Hulett Chief Medical Officer), adapted an existing design to develop  
a low-cost High Oxygen Efficient Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (HOE-CPAP) breathing aid.  
CPAP-type units assist breathing by supplying a mixture of air and oxygen through a tight-fitting  
mask that helps the patient take deeper breaths, improving oxygenation. 

The Tongaat Hulett Bucket Breathing Aid (BBA) is literally built in a bucket and provides a cheap but 
effective solution for patients requiring breathing support that will have benefits to healthcare facilities 
extending beyond COVID-19. It is currently undergoing review and certification in Zimbabwe  
and Mozambique. 

During the second wave, the BBA was used to treat patients in Zimbabwe, both at the Colin Saunders 
Hospital in Triangle and at the government’s main COVID-19 hospital. Feedback from medical practitioners 
at these facilities has been excellent and we have received requests for more units for both government 
and private hospitals in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mozambique. Additional units have been supplied  
to facilities in Zimbabwe and Mozambique in anticipation of the third wave of COVID-19.

The team also produced Perspex aerosol boxes to help protect healthcare workers from infection.  
The aerosol box creates a barrier between the patient and the person attending to them, reducing the risk 
of infection for frontline health workers.

The sale of the Eswatini, Namibia and starch businesses led to changes in a number of our Human Capital metrics including a reduction in 
employee headcount, number of training programmes, and employee skills composition.

Tongaat Hulett prioritises transformation in its workforce, 
localisation and the upliftment of women. In South Africa, the 
focus is on B-BBEE and employment equity, and localisation in 
Mozambique. The upliftment of women is a priority in all four 
countries of operations. 
Targets are set by HR teams and performance against key metrics 
in these areas is monitored on, prioritising non-discrimination and 
equal opportunities. 
In South Africa, performance is measured against the three-year 
employment equity plan for 2018 to 2021. Progress continues 
to be made in the representation of previously disadvantaged 
individuals at management levels and our recruitment  
processes and training programmes have a specific focus  
on designated groups. 
Progress in representation of designated groups in South African 
operations as a percentage of the total employees in the country 
is shown in the graphs following.
Women in the workforce increased from 18% in 2020 to 21% 
in 2021. Good progress was made at senior management level 
in South Africa, with women in senior management improving 
to 28%, from 21% in 2020. Representation of African women in 
senior management improved from 7.0% to 8.4% during the year 
and women in middle management increased from 15.5% to 
17.3%. Our Zimbabwe operations have a policy to fill skilled and 
management level vacancies with female candidates wherever 
possible. High-potential female employees have been identified 
and placed on development paths to accelerate their promotion 
to the executive level. At 31 March 2021, women made up 17% of 
the workforce in Zimbabwe, up from 14% in the previous year. 
We have identified that our pay parity between men and women 
in South Africa and Mozambique must be addressed. We remain 
committed to addressing this in a systematic and affordable 
manner. Country Managing Directors, Finance and the HR 
function are working closely to address this.
Our operations in Mozambique rely on expatriate skills in key 
areas. Most expatriates are on fixed-term contracts and work 
closely with local employees to ensure skills transfer to local 
Mozambicans, so that when their contracts come to an end these 
do not need to be renewed, reducing the number of expatriates 
on sites and increasing the number of appropriately skilled locals. 
During the current financial year, the number of expatriates 
reduced to 37 from 44 at the end of 2020. 

*  The definition of “top management” changed in 2020 to include only Tongaat 

Hulett Limited Exco members, where previously it also included Board 
members of operating companies.

PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Tongaat Hulett continues to explore 
opportunities to increase the number of 
employees with disabilities within the 
workforce. This process has included 
engaging with a South African NGO 
working to protect and promote 
the interests of people with mobility 
impairments. The number of employees 
with disabilities across all countries 
reduced to due to the sale of the 
starch business and exit of the Eswatini 
business, both of which employ a 
number of employees with disabilities. 
As at 31 March 2021 Tongaat Hulett 
employs 41 employees with disabilities, 
compared to 65 in 2020. We are 
considering conducting a workplace  
fit-for-disability audit to identify roles 
that could accommodate more persons 
with disabilities.

Y REDEPLOYMENT OF CRITICAL INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE 
D

Tongaat Hulett’s restructuring and rightsizing during 2019 reduced the workforce 
by 10 220 employees through the non-renewal of contracts, voluntary severance 
packages (VSPs), retrenchments, early retirements and natural attrition.  
While the process resulted in significant cost savings and enabled a refresh of 
business leadership, it also heightened the need to ensure that institutional 
knowledge is retained in the organisation and passed on to the next level of 
leadership. While formal structured training is an important aspect of skills 
development, practical on the job learning from an interested and experienced 
mentor will play an important role in skills transfer and knowledge retention.

This case study profiles three senior leaders in the company and their commitment to developing those around them 
to ensure that the industry knowledge and skills they have built up in their time as part of the Tongaat Hulett family 
continues to enrich the company into the future. 

NEVILLE LEWIS
Optimisation Manager 

Age 67

Neville has 29 years of experience in the sugar industry and a further seven years in the starch and glucose industries.  
He has been with Tongaat Hulett for nearly a decade and moved from the Xinavane refinery in Mozambique to the 
Hulett’s Refinery in Durban in 2020. 

Neville knows that there might never be a time when he feels that he has handed over absolutely everything,  
but he is a big believer in the power of systems and controls. 

“There are things that I like doing and there are things that I dislike doing,” he says. “My approach is to find ways of doing 
the things I dislike so well that I don’t have to keep doing them over and over.”

He also takes to heart the example Peter Gibson (previous Factory Manager at Xinavane), who always insisted that,  
“When you work in a foreign country, you must make sure you leave a legacy with the people you’ve worked with.”

When he retires, Neville says he never wants anyone to say, “This place is such a mess because Neville is no longer here”, 
and his goal for the next two years is to make sure that does not happen. 

“Some people want the organisation to miss them when they are gone, but I want to know that the systems, controls and 
people that I have left behind will be able to keep the business operating without me. I believe that the people I have 
worked with will have learned enough from me that not only will they be able to maintain the systems and processes, 
they will be able to improve them.”

TENDAI MASAWI

Managing Director of Tongaat Hulett Mozambique

Age 59

Tendai started his career as a sugar technologist and rose through 
production to management, working at various locations in the 
sugar industry, particularly at refineries. He joined Tongaat Hulett in 
Zimbabwe in 2012 as the Technical Director for Hippo and Triangle 
(to 2019) and then moved to Tongaat Hulett in Mozambique as the 
Chief Operating Officer before being appointed Managing Director. 

“The more you work within these environments, the more excited 
you get about the work that you do,” he says of his more than 30 years 
in the sugar industry.

He sees excellent opportunities for Tongaat Hulett’s Mozambican 
operations and has a passion for developing local skills, both 
in the company and in the region. “We have put in place a new 
management team in Mozambique that can help to put the 
company back in order and create a business that is not only 
sustainable but also increasing its contribution to the economy.” 

Tongaat Hulett Mozambique has been able to increase its domestic 
production of refined sugar to the point where the country no  
longer needs to import sugar for various manufacturers.  
Tendai’s goals include commissioning an ethanol plant in 
Mozambique and ultimately moving to a technical consulting  
role to help address specific issues. 

But one of his key focus areas for the next four to five years is to 
continue to impart knowledge to the next generation of process 
engineers. “While there’s ultimately a desire to be able to slow down, 
I have developed a significant amount of knowledge and experience 
that I want to be able to impart to the next generations,” he says. 
He has a particular interest in building the skills and experience of 
those who have been historically disadvantaged through poor access 
to the types of schools and career development opportunities that 
others may have had.

Literacy levels in Mozambique are low, particularly among women, 
and in terms of developmental infrastructure such as schools and 
health facilities, it is one of the world’s poorest countries. In 2020, 
there was a significant reliance on expatriate skills to provide 
technical support for Tongaat Hulett’s operations in the country. 
Tendai’s goal is to develop the necessary skills in-country to reduce 
this to fewer than 40.

“We are working with universities and technical schools to identify 
young prospects with the necessary aptitude and potential who 
can be brought into the company to work with more senior people 
to develop critical skills. We have a formal mentorship programme 
that is coupled with an effort to give learners access to experience 
in our operations in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Our hope is that 
the person-to-person interactions from these visits will benefit the 
company through the cross-pollination of ideas to ensure that every 
aspect of Tongaat Hulett is a success.”

By the time he retires, his goal is for Tongaat Hulett Mozambique 
to be a leading agri-business in the region and to improve the 
performance of Mafambisse so that it generates significant profit. 
“At the same time, I’d like to increase the number of key local skills 
in the company’s leadership and reduce the company’s reliance on 
expatriates. Ultimately, it would be good to see the company being 
run by a 100% local workforce.” 

MICHELLE JEAN-LOUIS
Business Assurance Executive

Age: 48

Michelle started at Tongaat Hulett in Internal Audit  
before moving on to Investor Relations and 
Communications Manager. Her current portfolio covers 
Internal Audit, Forensics and Sustainability, including SHE. 
Since March 2020, Michelle has chaired the COVID-19 war 
room with a small team of leaders who have developed 
and implemented the necessary protocols.

“Having spent 20 years in the organisation, I have been 
involved in many aspects of the business,” she says.  
“I have developed a lot of experience and knowledge 
about some of our successes and failures over that time 
and I need to ensure that we never repeat the mistakes 
that we made in the past.”

One of the reasons she remains committed to 
Tongaat Hulett is to use her skills and experience to help 
develop the next generation of leaders, particularly female 
leaders. She approaches training and mentorship with the 
intention of making sure that whoever she trains becomes 
twice as effective as she ever was. “That way, my skills 
and experience will not be missed. I may be missed as an 
individual, but I do not want to be missed for the work that 
I did. As a leader, the goal must always be to ensure that 
those who follow you are better than you, and that just as  
i always aspire to be better, those who work with me 
should aspire for the same.”

While she recognises the value of institutional processes, 
she has a strong belief in the importance of the individual. 
“Processes will only be as effective as the people working 
with the processes. Part of what constitutes ’effective’ 
is ensuring that the individuals are not only skilled and 
capacitated, but motivated and encouraged to want  
to improve.”

“While the challenge to balance personal and work 
commitments is ever present, the primary aim is to ensure 
that balance doesn’t come at the expense of performance. 
One critical influencer of success in this regard comes from 
a real love of what I do. I feel very privileged to work for this 
organisation and with my colleagues.”

Michelle mentors a group of women at the corporate 
office. She facilitates monthly meetings, most often in a 
relaxed off-site setting, to create opportunities to discuss 
challenges and opportunities, and to address these at 
individual level.

The results of this process are tangible. Their combined 
commitment has led to a significant improvement in the 
overall performance of the group Sustainability team.

“When you’re passionate about something, you’ll always 
find the time to do it. I’m passionate about people,  
and everything I do comes back to my desire to help  
others succeed.”

STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS

The Board takes a stakeholder-inclusive approach in executing its 
governance role and responsibilities that balances the needs, interests 
and expectations of material stakeholders in the best interests of the 
organisation over time. Responsibility for the oversight of stakeholder 
relationships is delegated to the Social, Ethics, Health and Safety 
Committee (SEHSC). The Committee regularly reviews the stakeholder 
engagement framework and the company’s methodologies for 
identifying and ranking the individual stakeholders. Stakeholder 
workshops with appropriate registers are maintained to ensure 
ongoing monitoring of stakeholder relationships. 

Stakeholder engagement and improving internal and external 
communications have been a significant focus areas during the 
turnaround and restructuring to keep key stakeholders informed.  
A stakeholder engagement action plan was established at the start 
of the 2021 financial year and progress was reported against planned 
engagements. These were aligned with the changed requirements of 
the COVID-19 environment with most interactions shifting to remote 
engagements such as online meetings, webcasts, webinars and 
livestream remote operational site visits, as applicable. These were 
also informed by the results of the corporate reputation survey to 
address key challenges identified by stakeholders.

MEASURING OUR PROGRESS
In the first quarter of 2021 Tongaat Hulett commissioned Ipsos, an independent market researcher and public opinion company to 
again conduct a corporate reputation survey across key focus areas. The survey sampled employees and other stakeholders, including 
shareholders, customers, suppliers and the media. The results of the survey provide an external assessment of our progress against the 
same survey conducted at the start of 2020, offering insights into our position relative to our peers and highlighting areas for improvement 
to further refine our engagement strategy. 

The results showed improvements across most of the metrics surveyed and indicated that 89% of stakeholders and 91% of employees 
sampled, believe that Tongaat Hulett is going in the right direction. Areas for improvement raised by the survey are being assessed so that 
these can be addressed.

MATERIAL ENGAGEMENTS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS DURING THE 2021 FINANCIAL YEAR INCLUDE: 

SHAREHOLDERS 

The Board engages with shareholders directly at the annual 
general meeting (AGM). The CEO, CFO, executives and the Investor 
Relations manager interface regularly with institutional investors 
through various presentations and scheduled meetings as part 
of the company’s investor relations programme to keep them 
appraised regarding developments in key strategic themes. 

In addition to results presentations and virtual roadshows, this year 
we also presented a COVID-19 webinar on the company’s response 
plan, business progress update meetings and one-on-one remote 
meetings with investors. 

The HR and Business Assurance executives have had structured 
engagements with shareholders on evolving dynamics in the 
remuneration and environmental, social and governance 
spaces respectively. 
COVID-19
Tongaat Hulett’s COVID-19 response included extensive 
engagements with employees, communities, non-governmental 
organisation (NGOs) and government to understand the needs of 
key stakeholders, ensure compliance with the rapidly developing 
legal frameworks, plan an effective response and coordinate relief 
efforts. 

   More information regarding our COVID-19 response is 
available on page 24. 

PROVIDERS OF CAPITAL
Reducing the company’s unsustainable debt burden is a critical 
aspect of Tongaat Hulett’s turnaround strategy. The company 
engages with its funders on an ongoing basis to keep them 
informed regarding material transactions to free up capital and our 
progress towards meeting debt reduction milestones. 

A second restructure of the company’s existing debt facilities was 
concluded with our South African lenders in November 2020.  
While Tongaat Hulett achieved the debt reduction proceeds 
milestone at 31 March 2021, the debt reduction transactions 
agreements target was not met, and we engaged with lenders  
to amend these agreements. 

   More detail on the transactions underlying these 
engagements is available in the 2021 Integrated Report. 

CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS,  
FUND MANAGERS AND ANALYSTS
Following the 2020 annual results presentation, we engaged an 
external service provider to conduct an independent assessment 
of the views of shareholders, fund managers and analysts.  
The survey gathered feedback regarding the company’s progress to 
date, what the market likes about the company, their concerns and 
what the market expects Tongaat Hulett to deliver going forward.

Positive feedback was received regarding the transparency and 
visibility of the executive team, as well as the progress made to 
date. Concerns expressed included debt levels and the uncertainty 
at the time regarding the disposal of the starch business 
(subsequently concluded). 

THE SUGAR INDUSTRY MASTERPLAN
Tongaat Hulett has been participating in the development of the 
Sugar Industry Masterplan together with industry peers and key 
stakeholders, under the guidance of the dti. The Masterplan aims 
to increase the sustainability of the South African sugar industry. 
Regulations for the implementation of the plan were approved 
in June 2020 and the final plan was signed by all participants in 
November 2020.

   Refer to the Operating Context section of the 2021 Integrated 
Annual Report for further detail.

GOVERNMENT
Meetings were held with the Department of Economic 
Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (EDTEA) and the 
Darnall community to create a structure for the community and 
Tongaat Hulett following the mothballing of the Darnall Mill. 

Tongaat Hulett Property interacted on an ongoing basis with the 
eThekwini and KwaDukuza municipalities, as well as the Office 
of the Premier of the KZN province, regarding planning and 
infrastructure.  

These engagements aim to create strong partnerships and 
improve collaboration on infrastructure solutions. They will also 
improve understanding and alignment of the key issues within the 
communities in which we operate.

64

LOCAL  
BUSINESSES
Entrepreneurship and business skills workshops for small 
businesses were held for Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises 
(SMMEs) in the Maidstone Area. 

Similar workshops at the other mills unfortunately had to be 
postponed due to the second wave of COVID-19. 

Tongaat Hullet collaborated with business communities to provide 
support and skills transfer to SSGs and build relationships with all 
growers. 

SUPPLIERS
Various communications were issued to suppliers regarding 
COVID-19 related information, business updates including the sale 
of the starch business, and fraud and fraud prevention.

EMPLOYEES

The company’s new values were launched and rolled out, 
supported by a values recognition campaign that commenced in 
January 2021. 

The new success management (performance management) was 
rolled out and is being implemented. We instituted the Senior 
Executive Forum and held workshops around the forum. 

A dipstick survey was conducted with representatives from SHE, 
HR, Communications and the operations in our four countries in 
preparation for an internal communications planning session.  
The survey showed improvements on areas identified as gaps on 
the Ipsos reputation survey. 

COVID-19 communications, campaigns and initiatives were an 
ongoing focus including the certificate of fitness, “My COVID-19 
Story”, and an “Are you a champion?” campaign. We conducted 
a COVID-19 survey of 2 600 employees that showed good 
understanding of the COVID-19 virus, prevention and  
company policies.
COMMUNITIES
Meetings were held with Tongaat-based business forums on 
upcoming procurement opportunities within Tongaat Hulett and 
the identification of barriers to entry for new businesses. 

These engagements improved our understanding of the key 
issues of local businesses and created platforms to share economic 
opportunities with forum members.

DARNALL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTS ESG
Tongaat Hulett is engaging with members of the Darnall community following the mothballing of the Darnall Sugar Mill. The mill was 
established in 1846 and people in the surrounding area have a strong multi-generational connection with the operation, as many 
worked in the mill as full-time employees or fixed-term contractors. 

The mill’s low capacity utilisation and high production costs made it necessary to mothball the operation to improve efficiency, reduce 
debt and secure the financial sustainability of the company and thereby protect jobs across the group. 

The company engaged with employees and community representatives since the decision was announced in February 2020. 

In August 2020, protests began in the Darnall community and further engagements commenced amid COVID-19 restrictions. Over time, 
the unrest developed and culminated in various incidents including intimidation of company employees, obstruction of operations and 
theft of company property. 

Tongaat Hulett continues to engage with community representatives directly and through a multiple stakeholder forum including 
municipal and provincial government to find mutually beneficial outcomes while taking a firm stand against lawless behaviour. 
Complaints from former employees are being investigated and opportunities to stimulate job creation, skills development and SMME 
development were discussed.

The table that follows provides more information on Tongaat Hulett’s key stakeholder groups, engagement channels, stakeholder priorities 
and the company’s response.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTSOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL04SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

SED spend increased to R122.4 million in 2021
Tongaat Hulett is committed to the well-being and sustainable development of the communities in which we operate.  
Our investment in SED supports projects that aim to drive sustainable rural and local economic development and work in collaboration 
with our communities, governments and other stakeholders.

Programmes are designed to meet the needs of the unique dynamics of local communities and align with the societal and national 
development priorities of the areas in which we operate. They also incorporate and contribute towards the achievement of the priority 
issues contained in the SDGs.
The principles we embrace in our approach to SED include:
Corporate governance – we adhere to legal and accepted business practices.

Social sustainability and innovation – we develop innovative, practical approaches to transform society and the environment thereby 
uplifting communities.

Corporate social responsibility – we demonstrate responsibility to society by minimising any negative impacts and extending 
philanthropic and charitable inputs to the communities that we operate in.

Tongaat Hulett’s current focus on securing the sustainability of the company by curtailing costs and paying down debt constrains  
capital availability across the business. SED, however, remains a priority and in 2021 R122.4 million was invested across our operations  
(2020: R87.9 million), with more than 90% of this allocated to initiatives in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where there is significant  
need for support. 

KEY ELEMENTS OF SED SPEND FOR 2021
Healthcare
•  We make a significant investment in running local healthcare 

facilities for our employees and local communities as most 
operations are based in rural areas. 

•  R99.9 million (2020: R51.5 million) was invested in  

health-related activities.

Education
•  We invested R6.8 million (2020: R6.2 million) in education 
initiatives, including the ongoing provision of water and 
electricity to several schools, transport, maintenance, school 
books, furniture and bursaries.

Environment
•  R5.5 million was invested in various programmes including 

bilharzia and malaria control and other environmental health 
initiatives.

Projects supported during the year included:

•  A rice production and fish project run in partnership between 
our Mafambisse operation and the Mozambican government 
that made more than 600 hectares of fallow land available to 
239 beneficiaries, 140 of whom are women. Tongaat Hulett also 
provided certified rice seed as well as land preparation, as most 
of the farmers lack funding. To date, 136 hectares have been 
ploughed and graded for associations and 51 hectares have 
been seeded. 

•  A fish project on the banks of the Púngùe River involves  

15 farming associations benefitting 239 families.  
The Mozambican government provided cages, animal feed, 
training as well as technical assistance, and Tongaat Hulett 
contributed land (a lagoon) in which to breed tilapia. 
We also provided 1 350 fingerlings that are expected to yield 
a harvest of 9 000kg worth of adult fish over a period of six 
months in the first phase of the project. The project has created 
four direct jobs and as it grows, will extend to the cities of 
Dondo, Beira and Nhamatanda. It also provides food security to 
our local community.

•  Tongaat Hulett has for many years supported PROTEC in the 
town of Tongaat, South Africa, as part of our SED Education 
initiatives. PROTEC is a leading South African NGO, operating 
nationally in the field of science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics (STEM) that runs an excellence programme 
for disadvantaged learners who have the potential and the 
right attitude to change the course of their lives. Their 10-year 
programme starts in Grade 10 and continues until after students 
have completed university, and their graduates have gone on to 
become engineers, doctors and entrepreneurs. While the focus 
is on STEM education, they also provide soft skills training and 
provide mentorship and support to students who come from 
poor and sometimes very difficult home situations. In 2020 the 
programme had to be adapted for COVID-19, limiting  
face-to-face engagements and increasing the use of online 
lessons and WhatsApp groups. 

•  Tongaat Hulett partnered with the Southern Lodestar 

Foundation to donate 60 tons of high energy porridge to 
children in local communities in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, 
South Africa and Eswatini at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. 
The instant porridge was also supplied to primary schools 
and hospitals, using our infrastructure, logistic network and 
stakeholder relationships to accelerate the distribution.  
Through the partnership, 400 000 meals were made available 
to children and individuals who were experiencing hardship 
because of the pandemic.

SUSTAINABLE  
AGRICULTURE

HUMAN RIGHTS  
AND CHILD LABOUR

As part of our inclusive 
growth objective,  
Tongaat Hulett continues 
to support small-scale 
farmers in partnership  
with governments and 
other stakeholders. 

Small-scale farming is an integral part 
of our supply chain and an important 
enhancer of local economies that 
provides employment, income and 
poverty eradication in rural communities, 
and represents an important opportunity 
to draw women and youth into the 
economy. 

Tongaat Hulett’s partnership with the 
Jobs Fund, which ran from 2014 to 2018 
established 10 972 hectares of sugarcane, 
creating more than 3 000 jobs. Through 
the project, 1 286 local community 
members received training in a range 
of qualifications, from multi-year tertiary 
qualifications and certificate courses in 
farm management to on-the-job training. 

The partnership continues to benefit 
rural communities with 5 800 current 
beneficiaries. In the past four production 
seasons, about R82 million has been 
distributed directly to beneficiaries  
– a significant amount given that it 
excludes the wage earnings generated  
by the project.

As a signatory of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights and a member of the UNGC, Tongaat Hulett is 
committed to respecting internationally recognised  
human rights standards. 

This includes avoiding causing or contributing towards adverse human rights impacts 
through company activities, and seeking to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights 
impacts directly linked to Tongaat Hulett operations, products or services by business 
relationships. We aim to prevent human rights infringements such as child labour, forced 
and compulsory labour, unsafe and unhealthy working environments, and constraints to 
an employee’s freedom of association, both within our company and in our supply chain.

This commitment to human rights is emphasised in our Human Rights policy, Code of 
Conduct and Business Ethics and our Sustainable Sugar policy, and incorporated into 
our SHE policies and procedures. The company’s strategic sourcing approach includes 
a human rights provision in all new supplier contracts and human rights are an integral 
part of the Supplier Code of Conduct. We recognise that there are areas where complicity 
in human rights abuses may arise, particularly by some suppliers of sugarcane, and we 
proactively engage with our sugarcane suppliers with a particular focus on the non-
adherence to the Supplier Code of Conduct. We work with various industry groups to 
monitor sustainable and ethical practices in our supply chain and are periodically peer 
reviewed. The company is assessed annually on human rights by institutions including the 
American Sugar Refining Group and ProTerra Ethical Sourcing policy.

In the 2020 financial year, the company conducted an investigation of small-to  
medium-scale outgrower sugarcane farmers in Zimbabwe to ensure that they do not 
make use of child labour. The investigation found that sugarcane farmers are aware of 
laws and policies that prohibit the employment of children and the Zimbabwean farmers 
sampled in the investigation signed pledges that they will not practice child labour, 
failure of which will result in all Tongaat Hulett services offered to them being withdrawn. 
All sugarcane farmers are required to maintain detailed employment records of all their 
employees. Community education and engagements are ongoing to combat child labour 
and a monitoring mechanism is being implemented.

73

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTSOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL04SUPPLY CHAIN

Tongaat Hulett’s procurement practices support and accelerate the execution of the 
business goals and strategy by emphasising achieving best value while also advancing 
social sustainability and ethical practices. 

Local procurement resources at the business operations across the organisation are 
complemented by the small Strategic Sourcing team that engages with suppliers  
to identify and realise cost benefits. This collaborative and focused cost  
curtailment approach resulted in savings of R103 million in the current year  
(2020: R181 million). 

Stringent compliance measures and contracts management controls are in place  
to drive adherence to the Procurement Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct as well 
as the governance principles espoused in the Tongaat Hulett Code of Ethics.  
The Sustainable Sugar policy confirms the expectation we have of ourselves,  
our third-party supplying farmers, contractors and key suppliers to meet and commit 
to the standards we have set for sustainable sugar production. The policy covers  
ESG considerations, including human rights and labour conditions.

Tongaat Hulett works closely with the various government agencies and 
stakeholders in all the countries where it operates to ensure that, wherever possible, 
procurement is responsive to the needs of the community and supportive of the 
regional indigenisation and localisation efforts.

Preferential procurement in terms of B-BBEE is a particular focus in South Africa and 
the business continues to prioritise opportunities to increase spend with SMMEs, 
including local suppliers, and introducing additional Black Owned (BO) and  
Black Women Owned (BWO) enterprises into the supply chain. 

We continue to focus on improving access to supply chain opportunities through 
preferential procurement initiatives, including reserving certain contracts either 
partially or totally for designated groups. We also provide training and workshops 
for potential suppliers. In Mozambique and Zimbabwe, we advance indigenisation 
through flexible procurement policies and practices that are responsive to the 
needs of communities and promote preferential local procurement and supplier 
development. We are standardising procurement governance throughout the 
business with improved focus on contract management and supplier performance 
management. 

Enterprise development initiatives aim to promote access to the sugar industry 
supply chain by SMMEs. During the year, Tongaat Hulett’s ED initiatives included:

•  Small business workshops were held for SMMEs in the Maidstone area in 

December 2020 to promote entrepreneurship and business skills. Planned 
workshops in areas around the other mills were suspended due to COVID-19 
concerns. Virtual personalised business empowerment sessions with Maidstone 
beneficiaries began in March 2021. 

•  Tongaat Hulett provided discounted rental, fencing, security, water connection 
and property maintenance to the Blackburn Waterloo Business Support Centre, 
a township business support centre set up in partnership with eThekwini 
Municipality. 

•  Tongaat Hulett is providing funding to sink a borehole for water access, install 

an electricity meter and provide security for the Black Climate Smart Urban 
Agriculture project. The project arose from the conversion of the Blackburn Estate 
Hostel and housing into a 20 000 bird poultry egg farm in FY2020. The project was 
successfully piloted and is now being commercialised through third-party funding. 

•  Support and assistance including fencing, irrigation materials and seedlings 
was provided to two local BWO cooperatives in the Felixton area to produce 
vegetables.

Creating 
opportunities 
through access  
to affordable 
mobile data

Njabulo Maphumulo is 
a budding entrepreneur 
who has worked hard to 
expand his information 
and communications 
technology business, 
Mobit. His ambition is 
to transform people’s 
lives by building a 
network that allows 
people to access 
information affordably.

“Once people have information, they 
can innovate. They can grow, and that’s 
transformation,” says Maphumulo.

The start-up was born after Maphumulo 
realised that residents of his local 
Hambanathi township in Tongaat were  
far removed from the digital world.  
He wants to see everyone in Hambanathi 
connected to the digital world and 
opportunities, which he believes will also 
build their dignity and self-worth.

Maphumulo said Tongaat Hulett’s 
assistance since 2018 has been invaluable 
as it enabled his business to grow its 
capacity. “The main reason I sought 
assistance from the start was to get access 
to fibre internet as that would enable the 
business to provide faster internet access,” 
said Maphumulo”. Tongaat Hulett also 
provided non-financial support by giving 
Maphumulo’s business access to one of 
the towers which connects the Tongaat 
area to the fibre source in Ballito. 

Tongaat Hulett funded the material 
needed to make the mobile network 
tower which Maphumulo designed.  
Then, helped by locals, he welded the 
tower together in the Hambanathi 
before using a wheelbarrow to carry the 
tower and cement to the Tongaat Hulett 
premises where he installed the tower.

Since receiving financial assistance from Tongaat Hulett, the business has been able to 
sustain and add new customers. Maphumulo said that the business has also grown in 
terms of service quality. “This has meant that we can retain existing customers. The current 
and future plan is to reinvest revenue back into the business by purchasing new hardware 
and establish new sites in other areas.” 

Maphumulo has been working with local spaza shops as distribution channels for the  
data bundles. He does not have a fixed number of customers since the service is prepaid 
and not contract based but he is currently operating at capacity and in the next three to  
five years Maphumulo wants to have many more active users on the network,  
targeting 100 000 active users every month. 

“During school holidays, through the assistance of PROTEC, I was placed in an electronics 
repair shop which was in line with my love for technology says Maphumulo”. This helped 
propel him to starting his business many years later. 

PROTEC is a national non-profit organisation that runs excellence programme for learners 
from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds that have aptitude in maths

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTSOCIAL AND RELATIONSHIP CAPITAL04B-BBEE IN SOUTH AFRICA

Transformation in the company is monitored and overseen by the SEHSC. 

The company has a strong track record of actively contributing 
to building a more prosperous society and, while the previous 
Tongaat Hulett B-BBEE structure collapsed recently, the group 
continues to actively look for alternative ways to make a 
meaningful impact with the goal of reinstating the B-BBEE 
position of the group in the foreseeable future. We have set 
ourselves appropriate targets to make visible progress in the 
makeup of our people, leadership, shareholders and those 
actively involved in Tongaat Hulett. The improvements in 
representation of black employees and black women employees 

at management and skilled and supervisory levels in the South 
African workforce in the current year (see page 56) demonstrate 
progress in this regard.

The restructuring strategy included the creation of partnerships 
with a strong emphasis on maximising the company’s 
transformational impact while simultaneously improving the 
group’s financial sustainability. While progress on these initiatives 
was slowed by COVID-19, they nevertheless remain important 
priorities for the company.

KILIMANJARO

A transformative agricultural initiative launched in September 2019 to optimise the company’s direct  
sugarcane farming activities in South Africa. Tongaat Hulett exited a significant portion of its direct sugarcane 
farming activities by leasing company-owned farmland to Uzinzo Sugar Farming (Uzinzo) and other  
third-party growers, establishing Uzinzo as the largest black grower in the South African sugar industry.

Tongaat Hulett continues to explore opportunities to create transformation within the sugar milling business. 

While the initial PropCo business model may not have materialised as hoped, the company continues  
to review opportunities for smaller property partnerships. The objective would be to establish transformational 
entities for portions of our property portfolio in partnership with other co-investors and developers. 
A project in Zimbabwe that aims to increase the productivity of land through the development of  
4 000 hectares of virgin land for sugarcane farming for the benefit of 200 local farmers while creating  
2 000 new jobs. The project is well under way with more than 2 657 hectares already cleared to date,  
with the first 562 hectares of sugarcane having been planted. The finalisation of the remainder of the  
project will be dependent on obtaining suitable funding and various options are being explored.

The empowerment participation of SSGs in the South African 
sugar business, in line with the South African Sugar Masterplan, 
continues to be developed. The company is also exploring various 
alternatives in respect of specific assets of the South African sugar 
milling business, e.g. the refinery and Voermol Feeds®.

Tongaat Hulett is aligned with the B-BBEE Codes of Good Practice 
and in the 2020 annual verification, a Level 4 Status was achieved 
(2019: Level 4). Tongaat Hulett’s transformation efforts are closely 
aligned with national imperatives with an aim of contributing 
towards the creation of a more diverse and inclusive, socio-
economically active society.

The Board has set a target of achieving a Level 2 status in the next 
assessment and a gap analysis was performed to identify areas for 
improvement to achieve this goal. The group’s ownership score 
is anticipated to benefit from the sale of the starch business and 
our recruitment processes promote improvement in management 
representation. Our training programmes are being aligned 
to gaps identified against the B-BBEE scorecard and the skills 
development score will be supported by the management 
development programme.

FOOD SAFETY 

Tongaat Hulett’s longstanding reputation 
as a producer of high-quality food 
products is underpinned by the high  
brand awareness and acceptance that  
our market-leading brands enjoy in all  
our areas of operation. 

This reputation and the value of our brands are protected and 
strengthened through strict adherence to structured food safety 
processes that include managing sugarcane requirements on 
a non-genetically modified basis and applying a sophisticated 
identity preservation system. 

Our food safety management system is based on a supply chain 
risk approach that manages vendors of materials and services, 
plant operations and facility compliance, distribution services and 
customer requirements. The system integrates related risks and 
opportunities into the company’s business continuity plan. 

Three of our key operations comply with and are certified in terms 
of FSSC 22000, a Food Safety System Certification used by food 
manufacturers which is aligned with ISO 22000 and includes 
Good Manufacturing Practices, in terms of quality and food 
safety standards. FSSC 22000 is a globally recognised food safety 
certification programme and its requirements continue to evolve 
and further align with international best practices with respect 
to food safety. Compliance with these systems and processes is 
monitored through several annual customer audits that apply 
global audit protocols. 

All our production facilities comply with the principles of ISO 9001 
quality management system , but are currently not certified. Plans 
to certify operations that require this are currently underway. 
In South Africa, the operations have adopted Hazard Analysis Critical 
Control Points (HACCP), where appropriate. Downstream products 
supplied to the pharmaceutical industry are required to meet the 
standards of the Food and Drugs Act.

The need to continually upgrade operational facilities and 
equipment in our plants to ensure ongoing compliance with 
best practice in food safety is a focus when justifying capital 
expenditure and a part of management’s long-term focus on 
continual improvement. Key project areas include bulk storage 
facility improvements, additional foreign body arrest equipment, 
and enclosure of operational structures.

Our approach to food safety encompasses a focus on improving 
food safety compliance along our supply chain, including 
ensuring that there are rigorous programmes in place for our 
suppliers and distribution networks. Our engagements with 
key service providers and auditing programmes encourage 
certification to quality and food safety standards. There is also 
regular evaluation of risks in terms of food safety threats and 
vulnerabilities both within the operations and along the 
supply chain.

In line with escalating consumer rights protection awareness, the 
company has implemented food defence management plans 
in collaboration with outsourced service providers that raise 
awareness and improve security systems on product monitoring 
and traceability.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Tongaat Hulett holds two patents registered in Australia, 
Brazil, China, Colombia, Indonesia, India, Mauritius, Mexico, 
South Africa and the USA. It is a proprietor of 704 registered 
trademarks (with 73 pending) in Australia, Botswana, Lesotho, 
Namibia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, South Korea, 
Eswatini, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. The company has 
44 domain names registered to it.

Tongaat Hulett is transitioning from a decentralised to a 
centralised IP management approach. This was previously 
managed by four different law firms under the direction of 
different business units within the group, with trademarks 
registered in the name of various Tongaat Hulett entities. Towards 
the end of 2020 Tongaat Hulett appointed a single firm to handle 
the entire IP portfolio which included listing all the trademarks on 
a consolidated IT platform and initiating a process of consolidating 

ownership of all trademarks into the name of Tongaat Hulett 
Limited. As trademarks come up for renewal, we will confirm use 
and interest in order to rationalise  
the portfolio, where appropriate.

Most of the registered patents related to the starch business 
and subsequent to the sale in 2020, Tongaat Hulett now has two 
patent registrations. Similarly, the number of registered domains 
reduced to 44 from 89 previously, with the balance transferring to 
Barloworld with the sale of the starch business. 

Given the establishment of an in-house group Legal Department 
during 2020, we will in time issue an Intellectual Property 
Management Framework which will provide information and 
practical guidance to the business when engaging on  
IP-related matters. 

THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION

Quality, SHE and food safety performance is benchmarked against global best practices to promote continuous improvement and 
stakeholder satisfaction. Operations subscribe to and are certificated in terms of various internationally-recognised management systems 
and/or specifications.

PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY

Sugar or sucrose is a natural plant product derived from the sugarcane plant that is 
a natural and healthy contributor to the enjoyment of food as part of a balanced diet. 
Neither white nor brown sugar contains additives or preservatives of any kind. 

Tongaat Hulett complies with the relevant SHE legislation and 
quality in each of the countries in which it operates, while striving 
to implement industry best practice. 

Tongaat Hulett’s operations in Mozambique and Zimbabwe 
have partnered with government and other stakeholders to 
improve access to nutrition by fortifying sugar produced for local 
consumption with vitamin A, which is important for visual health, 
immune function and foetal growth and development.

As with any foodstuff, excessive consumption is not conducive to 
good health and over-consumption of sugar can lead to obesity, 
including child obesity. We ensure that appropriate information 
is provided to our customers and all product labels contain 

information about the product in compliance with the respective 
country legislation and labelling regulations.

Responsible sugar consumption is a critical element of 
Tongaat Hulett’s Sustainable Sugar policy, which emphasises the 
company’s support for relevant awareness campaigns and for 
government initiatives to promote responsible consumption 
by consumers. 

In early 2021, Tongaat Hulett published its Responsible Sugar 
Consumption policy in accordance with the company’s 
commitment to supporting government and society, that will 
guide the company’s related initiatives going forward.

The Huletts® Sugar brand in South Africa was re-energised last year to reflect its proudly South African heritage and partnered with  
Proudly South Africa. New packaging was launched in the current financial year across our core brown and white sugar portfolios  
as well as adjacent portfolios. The comprehensive marketing campaign that accompanied the brand refresh included an improved focus on 
telling the story of how Huletts gives back through our SED initiatives, and, despite the challenging South African consumer market, sales 
showed a significant, double-digit improvement.

In August and September 2020, we ran our #HulettsNationalHumthem campaign, a simple yet effective way to unite and spread hope in 
the midst of the global pandemic, while promoting Huletts® Sugar as a proudly South African brand. We invited South Africans to hum the 
South African National Anthem through their masks and share their national pride, with the added incentive of cash prizes that could be 
won through digital and in-store competitions. 

The #HulettsNationalHumthem campaign was recently considered best in class, winning gold in the Mobile Video category at this year’s 
Smarties Awards by the Mobile Marketing Association. The Smarties Awards are one of the world’s premier marketing showcases,  
and are held to honour the best and most innovative mobile campaigns.

For nearly 60 years, Voermol® Feeds has 
been at the forefront of scientific success in 
the animal feeds sector and is the market 
leader in the molasses and pith-based animal 
feeds industry in South Africa. The company 
is a proud part of the Tongaat Hulett family 
and recently undertook to evolve and refresh 
its corporate brand and packaging to better 
reflect our high-quality brand.
We consulted widely with key stakeholders including 
co-operative leadership, commercial and new era farming 
partners, as well as our sales team to gather input on our new 
look. The feedback received was very positive and influenced 
our design as we transitioned to “Beefing up our Bull”.  

The evolution of our brand imagery includes a new  
logo that remains very recognisable and retains our underpin 
line of  “What nature lacks, Voermol® will provide”. The new 
branding has been rolled out into new packaging and 
upgraded core sales and marketing assets to communicate 
our approach.

CANE GROWING PROCESS
Sugarcane has been cultivated since ancient times and is 
thought to have come from tropical South and Southeast 
Asia, with the likely origin northern India. Sugar production 
is a diverse industry that combines the agricultural 
activities of sugarcane cultivation with the industrial factory 
production of raw and refined sugar, syrups, and a range of 
other products, such as ethanol. 

Tongaat Hulett has been growing and milling cane  
since 1892.

The cultivation of sugarcane can involve a high degree of 
mechanisation in large commercial growers, but is more 
frequently a largely manual process for small- or medium-
scale growers, or in countries where socio-economic 
conditions require access to employment for large 
populations of lower skilled labourers.

The principal component sought from sugarcane is sucrose, 
or the disaccharide combination of two monosaccharides – 
glucose and fructose – which makes up around 13% of the 
weight of raw sugarcane. 

The actual sucrose level is influenced by a combination of 
factors, such as soil quality, access to water, temperatures 
(average temperatures as well as temperature cycles), and 
the overall length of the growth cycle. Although most cane 
is grown over a period of eight to 16 months, some varieties 
of cane can be managed over a period of up to two years, 
allowing the density of sucrose within the cane to mature 
more slowly for a variety of crop management reasons. 

While the growing of sugarcane requires a number of critical 
inputs, the processes employed to mill and refine sugar 
can have a number of impacts on the natural environment 
within which the cane is grown.

It is the responsibility of growers such as Tongaat Hulett to 
monitor its activities to ensure limited negative impacts on 
water sources, land and air. These could potentially include 
the degradation of land quality through over-farming  
and/or excessive use of agri-chemicals (fertilisers, herbicides 
and pesticides), the contamination of water sources 
through discharges of insufficiently treated effluent, and the 
pollution of air through discharges of particulate matter,  
or even via inadequate suppression of dust emanating  
from stockpiles of bagasse (the fibrous material that is left 
over after sucrose has been extracted from cane in the 
milling process).

Without access to land that is of sufficient nutrient value  
for the growing of cane, in areas where growers have access 
to substantial volumes of water, either through high rainfall 
levels or access to rivers, streams or underground aquifers, 
the production of sugar would not be possible.  
In South Africa, cane is grown mostly along the coastal 
regions of KZN, where irrigation is almost entirely the result 
of rain, whereas irrigation from rivers, streams and boreholes 
is required at the company’s agricultural operations in both 
Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

FIELD LAYOUT
Fields are levelled, drainage systems established,  
contours planned and roads constructed to ensure ease  
of access to the field.

LAND PREPARATION
The remains of the old crop are destroyed and a seedbed 
prepared to ensure good germination of the seedcane.

PLANTING
Sections of immature cane stalks called setts are planted in 
the furrows together with fertiliser and then covered with soil.

RATOON CULTIVATION
Fertilizer promotes development of the plant.  
Weeds are removed by hand or using herbicides.

GROWTH
Sugarcane can be harvested after 12 to 16 months when  
it has reached a height of 2 to 4 metres.

HARVESTING
The cane is harvested from April to December. Traditionally 
the cane is burnt prior to harvesting to remove leaves, weeds 
and other trash that could delay harvesting and milling. 
However, there is a concerted effort to increase the area that 
is green cane harvested. The cane stalks are cut off at ground 
level, stripped of leaves, topped and gathered into bundles.

TRANSPORT
The cane bundles are moved from the fields to loading areas 
and then taken to sugar mills by rail, tractor-trailer or heavy 
road vehicles.

MILLING
The cane stems are crushed and shredded at the sugar mills 
using rollers in a process called grinding. Hot water is sprayed 
over the shredded material to extract the remaining sugar. 
Ethanol is a by-product of sugar production and the dry fibre 
(bagasse) left after removing the sugar juice can be used as 
fuel for energy production or as an alternative source of pulp 
of paper production.

REFINING
The raw sugar is sent to refineries for processing into  
refined sugar.

About ethanol 
Ethanol’s first use was to power  
an engine in 1826, and in 1876,  
Nicolaus Otto, the inventor of the 
modern four-cycle internal combustion 
engine, used ethanol to power an  
early model. 
Although meilies (corn) became the predominant 
feedstock for ethanol production because of its 
abundance and ease of transformation into alcohol, 
sugarcane is also used as a key source. 

Ethanol results from the fermentation of starches 
extracted from sugarcane into sugar and then 
into alcohol.

Although used as a fuel source for early combustion 
engines, including the first automobiles, ethanol was 
all but ignored as a fuel despite its more favourable air 
quality properties, such as lower carbon emissions. 

Used also for the production of alcoholic beverages, 
ethanol played a key role during the COVID-19 
pandemic as a critical input to the production 
of sanitisers used to protect people from touch 
transmission of the virus.

In 2021, Tongaat Hulett produced over 30.6 million 
litres of ethanol, a more than 10% increase over the 
27.7 million litres produced in 2020.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTNATURAL CAPITAL06LAND CONTINUED

The most 
material 
issues 
associated 
with land 
include

Degradation of nutritional land value from natural causes such as increased  
salinity (salt levels) due to the encroachment of ocean coastlines resulting  
from storm-initiated erosion and/or climate-related rises in sea level.

Degradation of nutritional land value through over-farming and/or insufficient 
periods of fallow, or rest periods, allowing land to “relax” without being required  
to produce cane.

Degradation of natural nutritional levels resulting from the over-application  
of agri-chemicals.

Decreased cane growing potential due to location-specific impacts of  
agricultural pests and diseases.

Habitat contamination from cane debris, dust and other particulate matter.

Tongaat Hulett has long held the view that the appropriate management of land is a critical requirement for the ongoing sustainability of 
the company. It is not, nor ever has been, in the best interests of the company, its shareholders, or the communities around which cane is 
grown to ignore the need to manage cane growing land with a sustainability-rooted forever mindset. 

This forever attitude is shared by Tongaat Hulett and its many cane growing partners, noting that of the 175 043 hectares of land farmed 
in 2021, only 30% was farmed by the company itself, while 42% was farmed by large-scale commercial growers and 28% was farmed by 
company-supported small-scale growers. 

During the 2021 period, Tongaat Hulett grew cane on a total of 52 883 hectares, while 2 847 was left to fallow, and an additional 4 475 
hectares is deemed of insufficient quality to continue cane farming. 

Fallowing land is an age-old natural recovery method used to give soil a break from the stresses of producing crops. Within Tongaat Hulett, 
the amount of land set aside for fallowing can be as high as 10%, whereas in 2021 only 5.6% of the total land available for cane growing 
was deemed of a reduced productive quality necessary for it to be left to fallow.

Other measures employed to improve the density of sucrose per hectare of land farmed include the planting of as much as 10% of cane 
land with new root stock on an annual basis, and the responsible application of fertilisers to enhance the natural levels of soil chemicals 
such as nitrogen and potassium to encourage healthy sucrose production within the cane.

Propelling small-scale farmers to success 

Y Operation Sakhinzuzo:

C

Operation Sakhinzuzo is a R74 million development 
partnership co-funded by the EDTEA and Tongaat Hulett. 
The partnership was established in 2017 and is being 
implemented and supported over six years to 2023 to 
support small-scale sugarcane farmers in the province 
by developing 3 000 hectares of land in freehold and 
communal areas.

The main objective of the programme is to stimulate economic activity and 
sustainable agricultural production for rural communities and the broader 
sugar value chain on the KZN North Coast. This will be achieved through  
ED that provides technical and financial support for established individual  
SSGs in rural communities, freehold growers and newly formed cooperatives  
to capitalise on economies of scale.

The land under development supplies sugarcane to Tongaat Hulett mills in 
Maidstone, Amatikulu and Felixton. Individual grower planting comprises 
2 250 hectares and to date, 287 individual growers have benefitted from the 
programme, each owning between 5 and 30 hectares after participating  
in the programme. 

The remaining 750 hectares is planted under cooperatives, with the goal of 
helping the newly formed cooperatives to enter the sugar industry and farm 
for themselves as small businesses. The grant funding in this category is fully 
funded, covering all the costs of planting and sugarcane maintenance until 
the crop has canopied, at which point it is handed over to the members of the 
cooperative to run themselves. The planting of sugarcane is done by selecting 
contractors who are appointed through an open tender process. 

Tongaat Hulett provides training, technical and mentorship support to the 
cooperative beneficiaries and 29 primary agricultural cooperatives have been 
formed in the Amatikulu and Felixton mill areas.

The programme creates jobs and helps to alleviate poverty in local 
communities. Job and contracting opportunities, such as cutting sugarcane, 
managing sugarcane fields after harvest and transporting harvested cane to 
the mills, are being created over the crop cycle – on average about eight years 
after the sugarcane is initially planted. Preferential choice for employment 
is given to those living within the communal area where the project is 
implemented. Local communities benefit from increased economic activity, 
improved health, reduce crime and improve road infrastructure. 

The project aims to support programme beneficiaries with small businesses 
to become sustainable over time and migrate them to becoming medium 
established enterprises.  

Planting started in late summer of the 2018 cane planting season and was 
completed by 31 March 2021. The EDTEA contributed R51.8 million and  
Tongaat Hulett R22.2 million to the partnership.  The EDTEA’s contribution 
covers inputs such as fertiliser, lime and chemicals for weed control,  
Tongaat Hulett paid for the seed cane costs and the approved growers 
contribute labour.

89

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTNATURAL CAPITAL06Wherever possible, Tongaat Hulett 
sources its water from rainfall. In 2021, 
only 77 858 hectares of land (44.4% of the  
175 043 hectares of land used for growing 
cane) required irrigation from various 
water sources such as rivers, streams and 
boreholes. A variety of methods are used, 
such as irrigation canals and ditches, 
overhead irrigation, pivot irrigation and 
drip lines, the last of which being the 
most efficient means of irrigation, but also 
an extremely expensive alternative,  
both in terms of money and time. 

In most cases, all water abstracted from 
sources enters a close-looped system 
that increases the overall efficiency of 
the water use process. Water that is not 
consumed by the cane, plus excess 
rainwater, is captured in canals and  
redirected back into the irrigation process. 
There are specific cases where water 
may be diverted for uses other than cane 
irrigation, such as to supply communities 
with access to water for their own use. 
In other cases, water may be lost due to 
evaporation, overflows, or system failures 
such as the collapse of a canal or ditch 
wall. Where possible, all water discharges 
for third-party use are measured and 
subtracted from the total volume of 
water imported, to calculate a net water 
consumption value.

WATER

Sucrose is produced via photosynthesis, which is a natural process through which green 
plants, in the presence of an abundance of energy in the form of sunlight, convert 
water, carbon dioxide and organic minerals into oxygen and sugar. In the absence of 
water, photosynthesis cannot occur and sugar cannot be produced.

Wherever possible, sugarcane is grown in areas with an abundance of rain so as to 
reduce agricultural demand for water abstracted from sources such as rivers, streams 
and boreholes. This is particularly the case at the company’s South African and 
Mozambican operations, especially at Mafambisse, due to the close proximity to the 
coast, and therefore coastal rainfall patterns that tend to outperform more inland 
conditions, such as in Zimbabwe and at Xinavane (also in Mozambique).

The most 
material 
issues 
associated 
with water 
include

Periods of significantly reduced 
rainfall and an increasing reliance 
on supplemental water sources.

Increased water salinity due  
to coastal encroachments from 
storm erosion and/or rising  
sea levels.

Increased competition for water 
resources and/or stakeholder 
opposition to water use for cane 
irrigation, particularly during 
periods of water scarcity.

Contamination of water sources 
through the over-application of 
agri-chemicals that then seep out 
of cane fields.

Contamination of water sources 
through controlled and/or 
uncontrolled discharges of 
insufficiently treated effluent from 
milling and/or refining processes 
(including ethanol and animal  
feed production).

Sugar mills, by their nature, should theoretically be “net producers of water”, with the total 
volume of water entering the mill not being consumed, resulting in water being exported 
from the mill for other uses (including reuse in the mill at a later date). However, several 
factors lead to this not being possible. 

About 70% of sugarcane is water, when the cane first enters a mill, it is crushed and “ 
sugar water” is separated from the fibrous pulp material (bagasse) and the liquid is then 
sent through a series of processes to separate the sugar from the water. This “sugar water”  
is used in the milling process for a variety of purposes, ultimately being boiled to produce 
steam for sugar processing and/or to turn turbines that generate electricity.  
When processes, for whatever reason, are unable to operate at maximum efficiency, 
for example, where the water density in the supplied cane is low, the volume of water 
extracted from the cane must be supplemented. This water is sourced from rivers,  
streams, boreholes, or in rare circumstances (only within Tongaat Hulett’s Durban refinery) 
from municipal sources. 

In many cases, water in the form of effluent is treated and reused within the milling and 
refining processes, or for irrigating cane fields. However, there are other instances in which 
treated, and in some cases untreated water, is discharged back into the environment.  
In all controlled circumstances, the volume of water discharged is measured and 
subtracted from water inputs to calculate a net volume of water consumed.  

In summary, the total volume of water consumed by the company is the sum of all water 
used to irrigate fields where rainfall is insufficient to meet cane demand for water,  
together with all water used in processing or production. This includes processing and 
refining sugar, ethanol production at Triangle in Zimbabwe and the production of animal 
feed at Voermol® in South Africa.  

During the 2021 period, a net total of 834 868 megalitres (Mℓ) of water was consumed 
within the company, against a total of 1 689 655 tons of sugar produced. This calculates as 
494 m3 of water per ton of sugar produced.

Two water-related environmental non-compliance incidents occurred during the year 
(zero fines), the most significant of which being a discharge of untreated effluent from a 
storage dam at the Maidstone Mill. This incident led to an intensive investigation by both 
the group SHE team, and members of Exco, as well as an investigation by the South African 
Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) and the eThekwini Municipality.

The DWS issued a directive, while the municipality issued a non-compliance letter, but 
neither issued a fine. Nonetheless, Tongaat Hulett identified the need to fast-track a 
previously identified plan to improve the scope and capacity of effluent treatment at 
Maidstone. A new treatment plant will be constructed commencing in 2022. 

In Zimbabwe, an order was issued to Hippo Valley Estates by the Environmental 
Management Agency to improve the efficiency of the Chishamiso Sewage Ponds to 
improve the quality of sewage treatment serving one of our central villages.

In addition to these non-compliances, five Level 2 Environmental Incidents were recorded 
at Maidstone (3), Amatikulu (1) and Felixton (1). 

Two of the three Maidstone incidents were related to the overflow of effluent from the 
holding dam due to inadequate management of effluent volumes going into the holding 
dam, leading to the above-mentioned non-compliances. The third Maidstone incident 
was the result of a leak in an underground effluent pipe that runs along the site perimeter 
fence. The failure resulted into effluent spillage and surface runoff into thick vegetation 
along the Tongaat River.

While the efficiency of water used relative to sugar produced is the most reliable 
of metrics for water consumption, several factors can lead to significant variances 
in year-on-year comparisons, such as adverse weather (e.g. floods and droughts). 
Thus, water efficiency isn’t always an effective indicator of water management 
performance.

The Amatikulu incident occurred when an irrigation pump failure resulted in a temporal 
effluent holding tank overflowing to the bunded area and subsequently to the nearby 
road and the Amatikulu River. The site was using a temporal holding dam as a point of 
effluent transfer to irrigation due to the main effluent dam undergoing modifications.  
The effluent dam modifications have since been completed and use of the dam has  
been reinstated.

The Felixton incident occurred when the mill experienced operational challenges that 
resulted in the isolation of clarifier A, requiring a start-up of the B effluent system as a  
back-up. In contravention to site designs, the B effluent system was discharging to the 
Umhlathuze River which consequently resulted in river contamination. The B system was 
immediately isolated and will be reinstated when the monitoring processes are installed.  

Through these events, the entire team was reminded that even in the presence of 
effective policies, procedures and controls, unforeseeable incidents can still occur in the 
absence of regular and objective scenario planning and stress testing of overall business 
continuity plans for potential environmental incidents. The company used these incidents 
to question the potential for similar outcomes at all other operations, leading to additional 
modifications to water storage and treatment facilities.

Wherever possible, Tongaat Hulett manages its impacts on water quality through 
monitoring and testing procedures, inclusive of testing specific boreholes,  
effluent discharge monitoring, visual inspection, and the active engagement  
of interested and/or affected stakeholders surrounding our operations.

MANAGING WASTE

Aside from the use of land to grow cane, 
the management of hazardous and  
non-hazardous waste at all operations 
is an ongoing specific management 
focus area. While the company maintains 
a zero tolerance policy for improper 
management of hazardous waste, and is 
in full compliance to this commitment, 
the management of non-hazardous 
waste still presents potential for further 
improvements.
The ultimate goal is  
“zero waste to landfill”.
During 2021, a total of 184 tons of 
hazardous waste was disposed of 
through appropriately designated and 
regulated facilities serving our operations. 
This equates to a hazardous waste 
efficiency of only 0.109kg of hazardous 
waste per ton of sugar produced 
(0.144 in 2020). 

Over the past few years, improvements 
in data systems and controls has allowed 
our SHE teams to not only improve their 
ability to identify ways to further reduce 
the volume of hazardous waste to be 
disposed of, but also improve the quality 
and reliability of data submitted to the 
group for collation and reporting to 
our stakeholders. 

In 2021, a total of 6 717 tons of non-
hazardous waste was sent to landfills, 
while 297 050 tons of waste were 
recycled. This calculates to a non-
hazardous waste efficiency of 98.0%.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTNATURAL CAPITAL06AIR: INCLUDING CARBON EMISSIONS 

As a consumer of carbon dioxide (CO2), sugarcane and other green plants tend to be less sensitive to air quality issues than animals 
(including humans), and therefore the company does not look to control the use and/or consumption of air, but rather what it sends into 
the atmosphere, particularly via smoke stacks at our mills, refineries and our ethanol plant.

The most 
material 
issues 
associated 
with air 
include

Elevated levels of noxious compounds and other airborne pollutants such as  
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Sulfur Oxides (SOx) from smoke stacks. 

Elevated carbon emissions resulting from insufficiently managed carbon-based 
fuel consumption at mills, refineries, the ethanol plant and in mobile machinery 
such as cane haulage trucks.

Reduced air quality in areas surrounding mills as a result of dust emanating from 
bagasse stockpiles.

Reduced air quality in areas surrounding mills, and along roads leading to/from 
mills and agricultural operations as a result of dust emanating from vehicles.

Wherever possible, Tongaat Hulett manages its impacts on air quality through a variety of monitoring tools such as visual inspections, 
sample testing of smoke stacks, testing for particulate matter in materials captured within dust buckets placed strategically around our 
operations, and through the active engagement of interested and/or affected stakeholders surrounding our operations. 

During the reporting period, zero Level 2 or Level 3 environmental incidents were related to air quality complaints and/or non-
conformances. However, the company continues to monitor the quality of air emissions in all of our stacks, noting that improvements to 
existing, or the installation of new scrubbers, are required at some of our operations. These issues are in the process of being addressed on 
a risk-rated basis.

The single most effective way in which our impacts on air quality is monitored and managed is through the measurement and 
management of our energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. 

While an increasing number of JSE-listed companies have set ambitious “Net Zero” targets, Tongaat Hulett is not yet in a position to make 
such a bold commitment. However, the company’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions is not new, and now encompasses the 
following elements:

Switch, wherever possible,  
to green (or “greener”) fuels

•  Continue to switch from coal to an 
improved mix of coal and wood for 
the purposes of priming boilers during  
start-up procedures.

•  Where necessary, purchase fossil fuels 
with higher thermic/caloric values to 
reduce the amount of fuel required 
to generate the same amount of heat.
•  Continue to shift from non-renewable 

fuels (e.g. coal and diesel) to renewables 
(e.g. bagasse and wood) for the 
purposes of fuelling boilers.

Reduce demand for energy 
consumption per ton of sugar 
produced through improvements 
to plant and machinery

• 

Identify and repair weaknesses  
in boilers and steam pipes,  
for example, to reduce heat  
and/or steam losses. 

•  Replace older stationary 
equipment with more  
fuel-efficient equipment  
as and when possible.

•  Purchase vehicles with improved 
fuel efficiency when replacing fleet.

Improve overall operational 
efficiency by reducing planned 
shutdowns through improved 
shift scheduling of employees 

•  Continue to engage with 

employees and unions to extend 
the length and/or number  
of shifts to reduce demand for  
fuel consumption.

94

During the year, the total volume of fuels consumed (“direct energy”) increased from the prior year (2020). Meanwhile electricity consumed 
(“indirect energy”) significantly decreased from the prior year, with only a slight decrease in the amount of electricity self-generated, coupled 
with an increase in the amount of electricity exported to national grids and/or third parties (e.g. communities). This resulted in a net positive 
impact on the amount of electricity the company had to purchase, and therefore the amount of electricity-related energy consumption, and 
a significant improvement in the company’s electricity efficiency (amount of electricity consumed per ton of sugar produced). 

Overall energy efficiency decreased, with every ton of sugar produced requiring an average of 16.63 GJ of energy, whereas only 16.18 GJ 
were required per ton of sugar produced in 2020. However, it is estimated that due to the number of significant changes in the company 
over the course of the year, inclusive of improved data collection, collation and reporting of fuel consumption data, coupled with the 
sales of the starch business and operations in both Eswatini and Namibia, energy efficiency rates will only become truly comparable as 
from 2022. The most significant direct outcome of energy consumption is the impact this has on carbon emissions. During the year, total 
carbon emissions across the group decreased from 1.105 million tons to 557 144 tons.

OUR APPROACH TO CARBON TAXATION  
IN SOUTH AFRICA
The Carbon Tax Act (2019) was designed and implemented by 
government to hold not only itself accountable to the ambitious 
de-carbonisation goals South Africa declared at the United 
Nations Conference of Parties (COP 21) in December of 2015, but 
also to encourage South African companies to assist in this regard.

The “Paris Agreement” was adopted by 196 parties on  
12 December 2015 with the primary objective being to limit global 
warming to below two degrees Celsius above a pre-industrial 
baseline. To achieve this, all countries had to commit to finding ways 
to significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, 
in the measurable form of CO2e, and all countries ultimately had to 
push this commitment down to the business sector, farmers, private 
citizens and all other carbon emitting stakeholders. 

For South African companies, carbon tax essentially means 
that in the absence of making no effort to reduce and/or offset 
emissions, a levy of R120 per ton of CO2e would have to be paid 
to government for the purposes of raising funds to reduce carbon 
emissions at a national level.

For many companies, knowledge of a forthcoming carbon 
tax accelerated a process of identifying a viable approach to 
managing their carbon tax exposure. They could:

• 

invest in ways to reduce their emissions, primarily through 
improved energy efficiencies;

•  develop company owned and operated projects to offset 

•  purchase carbon credits by investing in carbon offset projects 

carbon emissions;

started by others; or

•  budget to pay the R120 per ton of carbon emitted.

In the case of Tongaat Hulett, South Africa’s carbon tax merely 
amplified the company’s long-standing commitment to 
protecting the environment, while reaping financial rewards, by 
reducing the company’s carbon footprint through a combination 
of process efficiencies and a conversion to lower carbon sources 
of energy. This process has been in place for decades, and the 
strategy has always been pegged to reducing emissions as much 
as possible, mostly through shifting away from the company’s 
largest contributor to carbon emissions, coal.

Bagasse, the fibre content of sugarcane that’s left over after the 
water and sugar has been extracted, has been used for many 
decades as a significant fuel source for heating water to produce 
steam used in the sugar milling process. However, the calorific 
value (ability to generate heat) of bagasse is not as high as either 
coal, which has been a critical input to reignite boilers on a weekly 
basis during the cane cutting season. To combat this, process and 
equipment improvements have been developed to reduce mill 

dependence on coal as a primary fuel source, including a shift to 
lower carbon fuels such as wood and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). 

While a goal of “Zero Carbon” is not possible in the context  
of sugar production, an alternate objective of “Carbon Neutrality”  
(or “Net Neutrality”) has been targeted within Tongaat Hulett for 
more than a decade. 

Tongaat Hulett began reporting on its carbon footprint in 2010, 
with the release of the company’s first carbon emission data 
within the Sustainability Report. Over the past 11 years, the 
company’s ability to collect, collate and report carbon emission 
data has consistently evolved, often at the expense of  
year-on-year comparability of reported data. As of this report, 
Tongaat Hulett is confident that the systems employed to 
measure carbon emissions have improved to a point where all 
future reporting can be benchmarked against our calculated 
emissions for the 2021 reporting period. 
For the year under review,  
total scope 1 and 2 emissions for the  
entire group was 557 114 tons.

Due to significant changes in the group’s operations, including the 
disposal of operations in Eswatini and Namibia, as well as the sale 
of the company’s starch operations, the data for carbon emissions 
is not truly comparable from a year-on-year perspective. However, 
the table on the next page serves to help reinforce our assertion 
that the company is committed to understanding where future 
investment in energy efficiencies, coupled with the ongoing 
conversion from non-renewable fuels to renewables, may help the 
company meet its current and future goals.
Our target for carbon reduction is to 
achieve a minimum of a 5.0% reduction 
against our 2021 emissions by 2025. 

In the meantime, Tongaat Hulett has taken the decision to reduce 
the company’s carbon tax exposure by purchasing carbon credits 
from a registered carbon credit supplier via Nedbank.

Through a contract with the City of Cape Town, Reliance collects 
“green waste” from various locations and composts it at its farm 
location near Stellenbosch in the Western Cape. By composting 
yard and landscaping waste (e.g. grass cuttings, tree branches, 
leaves, etc.), Reliance is able to significantly reduce the amount of 
methane (CH4) that would otherwise be generated as the waste 
decomposes, while producing an organ7ic source of compost 
for farmers and gardeners, while producing only CO2, which is 
roughly 25 times less harmful to the atmosphere than CH4.  
The resulting “carbon reductions” are therefore deemed  
“carbon credits” that companies can purchase to reduce their net 
carbon emissions. 

96

Mulching of locally supplied “green waste”

Unfortunately for carbon taxpayers, there’s 
a limit to how much carbon tax exposure 
can be reduced via offsets (10%). 
Therefore, the strategy for Tongaat Hulett 
is to continue to directly reduce carbon 
emissions through improved energy 
efficiencies and a move away from coal as 
a primary source of energy, with plans to 
identify and/or develop non-core projects 
that will help generate carbon offsets to 
move towards Net Neutrality.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTNATURAL CAPITAL06CLIMATE CHANGE

Tongaat Hulett has been mindful of its 
need to reduce harmful emissions into 
the air we breathe, the water we use for 
irrigation, and the land we use to grow 
sugarcane and other agriculture produce. 

Wherever possible, systems and processes have been developed 
to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels such as coal and diesel in the 
boilers required to produce sugar, while additional efforts have 
been made to reduce the amount of water we require to irrigate 
cane on our farms, or to be used in cane milling and refining.  
In many cases, these efforts have been underpinned by 
performance incentives, particularly at mills and refineries, either 
directly or indirectly, most notably through cost containment 
incentives in an operational environment where energy inputs 
(fuels and electricity) are critical components to financial viability. 

These efforts have resulted in attempts to maximise the use of 
bagasse as a renewable energy source in lieu of non-renewable 
coal and diesel. Bagasse is burned not only to produce the steam 
required to process sugar, but also to self-generate electricity that 
reduces our reliance on electricity generated by national suppliers 
primarily through the burning of coal. This has helped  
Tongaat Hulett minimise its carbon footprint by producing fewer 
tons of CO2e per GJ of energy required to produce an equivalent, 
or even greater, volume of both raw and refined sugar. 

While the practice of burning bagasse dates back to almost 
the company’s beginnings, the tracking of its impacts on the 
company’s carbon footprint only dates back to 2009. At the 
start, information was relatively scant, and not particularly 
reliable due to inadequate systems to consistently capture 
energy consumption data across all of the group’s operations. 
However, comparable quantitative data for carbon emissions has 
been reported annually since 2010, not long after the company 
started disclosing other key sustainability metrics (e.g. water 
consumption).

Over the past decade, as the impacts of climate change have 
become more immediate and costly, nearly every operation 
within the group has had to mitigate what we would now 
consider a climate change impact through site-specific responses. 
However, the issue of climate change as a group issue started 
to develop as key customers began seeking information about 
carbon and water efficiencies per ton of sugar produced, and 
as the government of South Africa embarked on its process to 
impose a carbon tax (which commenced in 2020).

OUR CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY
The ongoing sustainability of  Tongaat Hulett is predicated 
on understanding the company’s interplay between risks and 
opportunities, while acknowledging that the success of the 
company cannot occur in the absence of our stakeholders,  
and the various environments we operate in. The management  
of climate change is no different.

In order to remain a going concern in a world that can no longer 
ignore the impacts of climate change on weather patterns and 
changing geographies, Tongaat Hulett must continuously  
educate itself on how climate change impacts our people,  
our communities, the land upon which we grow our sugarcane, 
the water we use to irrigate farms and process sugar, and the 
impacts we have on the air we breathe. 

Taken to extremes, we must consider the potential impact climate 
change will have on the movement of people from areas severely 
impacted by floods, droughts, or land erosion, to areas we have 
designated for not only the growing and processing of sugarcane, 
but also for housing the communities that are core to our success. 
Climate refugees from areas of significant climate impact are 
expected to disrupt areas deemed more climate resilient.  
This would include areas away from risks of coastal erosion and 
flooding as sea levels rise, areas with high volumes of accessible 
water to sufficiently irrigate crops as temperatures rise towards, 
or perhaps even beyond, the critical threshold of two degrees 
warmer than preindustrialised averages, and areas that are able to 
adapt to longer summers and shorter winters or vice-verse. 

Historically, our approach to climate change has been one of 
addressing needs at the site-specific level. For example, land 
has been abandoned along the coast in Mozambique where 
increased salinity has relegated hundreds of hectares of company-
owned land unfarmable, while other areas in multiple locations 
have required the construction of dykes designed to hold back 
flood waters during periods of increasingly frequent and severe 
flooding. In some instances, measures have been put in place 
to mitigate increased risk of heat stress on employees during 
prolonged periods of intense heat. Through all of this,  
Tongaat Hulett has learned that mitigating climate change risks 
will require the involvement of every aspect of the business, from 
engineering and HR, through to our clinic and hospital staff.

IDENTIFICATION AND PRIORITISATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS
In the past year, Tongaat Hulett set about gaining a clearer understanding of our most 
material climate-related risks. Through an engagement process across all operations,  
with key leaders and staff already addressing climate-related impacts, 35 company-specific 
risks were identified. These risks were then presented to members of Exco for comment 
and prioritised into what is now the group’s list of 16 key climate change risks. The risks 
consider three critical elements: 

•  Probability of occurrence; 
• 
level of potential impact; and, 
•  ability to avoid and/or resolve.

Note: The following risks are at the group level, noting that the situation is likely to differ at 
the operation-specific level.

and waste due to extreme 
weather events.

9.  Shifting climatic conditions rendering 

process sites partially  
or fully redundant.

10.  Declining pasture productivity and 

increases in livestock mortality.
11.  Unsustainable use of fossil fuels.
12.  Social unrest due to increasing 

unemployment and  
climate-related migration.

13.  Loss of diversity, ecosystem 
disruption and habitat loss.

14.  Increasing pressure from government 

to lower carbon footprint.

15.  More onerous climate-related 

legislation, permits and  
insurance costs.

16.  Heat stress and other climate-related 

occupational incidents.

ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS ON 
CLIMATE CHANGE MATTERS
While the process of materiality 
determination was limited to the 
engagement of internal stakeholders, 
many respondents specifically mentioned 
considerations raised by one or more of 
the company’s stakeholders. For example, 
in Zimbabwe, where Tongaat Hulett 
owns and manages cattle, individuals 
mentioned a need to consider adjacent 
farmers when addressing the company’s 
livestock challenges, at least in part to 
maintain healthy relationships with those 
farmers, but also to reduce the potential 
for conflict. 

In addition, the issue of key customer 
enquiries about carbon and water 
efficiencies, and how these efficiencies 
might be hindered by climate-related 
impacts, influenced at least some 
participants to reflect not only on 
Tongaat Hulett’s preparedness for 
potential impacts, but on what others 
believe are probable outcomes in various 
scenarios that the company has not 
yet considered. For example, if global 
temperature averages are expected to  
rise by 2% over preindustrialised levels,  
and if Africa is projected to be subjected 
to even greater increases in average 
temperature, how will these new 
temperatures affect the sugar content 
of cane per hectare, and perhaps when 
sugarcane can be harvested?

Investors too have started to ask climate-
related questions, although many are 
still limited to merely asking about the 
presence of a climate change strategy, 
possibly due to residual uncertainty 
regarding how climate change is expected 
to impact investments in agriculture.  
This, however, appears to be changing. 
A growing number of analysts, particularly 
among the longer-term pension fund 
investors, appear to be becoming 
more aware of climate-related risk, and 
consequently of how they need to adapt 
their portfolios to limit potential losses.

Moving forward, Tongaat Hulett has 
recognised a need to provide many 
stakeholders with information regarding 
how the company is planning to manage 
its core businesses regardless of climate 
change. In doing so, the engagement 
of stakeholders via increased annual 
reporting (such as this, the company’s  
first ESG and Climate Change Report)  
and regular meetings will be expected  
to include increased ESG transparency.

MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS
Although not always explicitly designed to mitigate “climate change”, per se, several initiatives have already been completed throughout 
the group to mitigate chronic environmental risks that are expected to expand as the influence of climate change increase.

Within our agricultural operations, no less than the following has already occurred:

•  Dykes have been constructed around cane growing land to protect against flooding during periods of extreme rainfall, as well as  

to protect against soil erosion;

•  canals have been deepened, are regularly maintained to reduce build-up and/or risk of collapse, and weirs have been constructed  

to control the flow of water during periods of both drought and flood;

•  dams have been constructed to store raw water at a level equivalent to between 2 and 3 years of use; and
•  cane varieties have been selected to manage significant fluctuations in rainfall.

Within our milling operations, no less than the following has already occurred:

•  Raw water storage dam capacities have been expanded to ensure that all operations have sufficient water to manage up to three years 

of reduced rainfall and/or drought conditions;

•  closed-loop water management systems have been improved, and will continue to improve, to ultimately achieve a target of  
“Net Producer of Water” status, inclusive of effluent treatment plants to increase the percentage of water consumption that is  
recycled for re-use on site; and

•  process efficiency improvements have been made, and will continue to occur, to reduce each mill’s demand for fossil fuels in the  

critical boiler start-up phase. 

Within our property development operations, no less than the following has already occurred:

•  Bulk infrastructure planning for the provision of water and sewerage treatment in residential and commercial developments have been 

designed with 1 in 50 conditions considered, inclusive of current predictions of potential climate change impacts; and

•  all roads and bridges have been duly designed to consider current predictions for climate change impacts on rivers, streams,  

rainfall drainage, soil erosion and other potential issues.

Within all areas of the business, no less than the following has already occurred, and further improvement is being planned for:

identification and support for carbon sequestration activities to offset uncontrollable carbon emissions; 

•  Reductions in the use of fossil fuels to reduce our carbon emissions;
• 
•  updating of health monitoring to improve preparedness to address the rising risk of heat stress among employees; and
• 

improved climate change disclosure to government, regulators, investors and all other interested and affected stakeholders.

In addition, the group ensures that stakeholder engagement practices include regular interaction on the risks likely to escalate as/when 
periods of prolonged droughts or flooding, and/or extreme weather events occur. The engagement is geared not only to raise awareness 
of potential risks, such as predictable social unrest, but also to identify ways in which Tongaat Hulett can partner with peer companies, 
government agencies and NGOs to create long-term sustainable ways in which the negative impacts of predicted climate change 
conditions can be proactively mitigated.

TONGAAT HULETT 2021 ESG REPORTNATURAL CAPITAL06CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUED

ENVIRONMENTAL LEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE 
Tongaat Hulett has an integrated SHE policy that commits the company to compliance with all applicable legislation in the various 
countries in which we operate.

At present, Tongaat Hulett is in the process of upgrading safety systems from OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001 throughout the group, while 
improving upon and recertifying all operations against the ISO 14001 environmental management system. These systems require the 
implementation of legal obligation procedures to ensure that all applicable legislation is identified and complied to. This is done through 
the identification of business aspects and impacts and aligning applicable legislation in respect of operational site legal registers. 

To further support the group’s legal and regulatory compliance, Tongaat Hulett contracts a specialised service provider to identify legal 
updates on a monthly basis, and undergoes legal compliance audits by Shepstone & Wylie, Marsh (a business risk insurance firm) and  
KPMG (internal auditors) on a risk-based frequency.

The company also participates in various multi-stakeholder forums, such as the National Business Initiative (NBI), where existing, updated 
and/or new legislation is discussed.

As a responsible and ethical corporate citizen, the company 
entrenches a culture of organisational integrity that supports an 
ethical corporate environment. The SEHSC assists the Board in 
overseeing the consistent application of and compliance with 
the Code through reports compiled by the Corporate Security 
Manager and reported to the committee by internal audit. These 
reports detail the nature of the violation of the Code, any financial 
loss if applicable, the root cause of the violation, the disciplinary 
action taken, and whether any criminal or civil action will be 
undertaken, as well as any possible recovery.

Incidents of fraud, corruption, or unethical practices that are 
reported or detected through management controls are formally 
investigated, followed by formal disciplinary processes. All serious 
cases lead to criminal proceedings. Stringent implementation of 
the Code is adhered to across all operations daily. Compliance by 
directors, all employees and suppliers to the high moral, ethical 
and legal standards of the Code is mandatory, and if employees 
become aware of, or suspect, a contravention of the Code, they 
are urged to promptly and confidentially report it through the 
independent whistleblowing system, Company Secretary or senior 
officials at management level. The anonymous independent 
whistle-blowing service is operational in South Africa, Zimbabwe, 
Botswana and Mozambique. During the year under review, a 
reduction had been noted in the number of reports received, 
compared to the previous year. The whistle-blowing reports had 
been classified into seven categories and focussed investigations 
conducted into each.

Recent key focus areas in the management of ethics include:

•  Ongoing oversight of activities to ensure that an ethical culture 

is embedded in the organisation, such as monitoring the  
roll-out of a set of new values and actions to entrench these 
values in the organisation, as well as consideration of policies, 
practices and processes to instil ethics.

•  Stringent application of the zero tolerance policy for unethical 

behaviour and addressing any instances of unethical behaviour, 
where necessary.  

•  Approval and oversight of the roll-out of the Fraud Risk 

Management strategy and an Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
programme. Fraud investigation protocol guidelines were also 
tabled and noted by the committee. 

•  The company maintains a comprehensive annual awareness 

programme aimed at embedding a culture of sound 
governance and zero tolerance for misconduct/fraud.  
The programme also looks to revitalise the whistle-blowing 
service and highlight its benefits to both the company  
and its employees.
Instigating and considering the corporate reputation survey 
which tested stakeholders’ views on whether Tongaat Hulett has 
made progress in its efforts to be more ethical. 

• 

•  Consideration and approval of the GRC electronic platform 

project, to automate certain governance processes in different 
areas of the business. The areas included on the platform are 
Enterprise Risk Management, Business Continuity Management, 
Incident Management, Policy Management, Legal Compliance, 
Regulatory Compliance and Internal Audit.

CONFLICT OF INTERESTS 
The Code incorporates a formal procedure to regulate conflicts of 
interest. Directors or employees who encounter such conflicts are 
required to formally declare such conflicts of interests for these to 
be considered by the appropriate forum, which in turn guides as 
to how such conflicts are to be resolved and to be recorded.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
•  Overseeing Tongaat Hulett’s response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Tongaat Hulett invested over R78 million in 
COVID-19 preparedness and response initiatives. As part of 
its COVID-19 initiatives, more than 20 000 employees were 
screened for various illnesses within a Certificate of Fitness 
programme, which identified more than 100 employees as  
at-risk health cases to be further monitored. The exercise 
has been so successful that the intention is to ensure that 
all employees in Zimbabwe and Mozambique (where local 
health facilities do not exist in sufficient capacity) be screened 
for Certificate of Fitness testing on an annual basis so that risk 
cases can be monitored continuously. The company is also 
presently rolling out a vaccination programme to employees in 
Zimbabwe. We tragically lost 20 colleagues to COVID-19,  
with 1 049 infections reported by the business (viewed in 
the context of between 23 000 and 28 000 employees peak 
and off-peak seasons). We believe that our efforts to keep our 
employees safe were effective in minimising the number of 
infections and mortalities since the start of the pandemic. 
The Committee guided these efforts, as well as other health 
management programmes including HIV/AIDS and malaria 
management, which are closely aligned with the WHO in its 
approach and performance monitoring. 
        The companies’ comprehensive COVID-19 response is more 

fully described in the Integrated Annual Report. 
  and on page 24 of this ESG and Climate Change Report. 

•  During the period under review, the Committee also performed 
its responsibility of overseeing the performance of the company 
against its set SHE targets and objectives, as well as considered 
various reports relating to SHE risks and opportunities facing 
the company. The Committee was encouraged that the 
focused efforts and improvements in our safety culture have 
resulted in a 14% reduction in the lost time injury frequency 
rate (LTIFR) and lost time injury (LTI), was profoundly saddened 
by two work-related fatalities at the operations. The loss of life 
is deeply concerning and unacceptable. Of further concern 
are six non-work-related fatalities and 12 related to third-party 
operators. The Committee reviewed in detail all the fatality 
reports presented before it. SHE initiatives and risk management 
protocols receive stringent focus through leadership at an 
executive level and programmes that extend beyond just 
Tongaat Hulett’s operations to include contractors, service 
providers and, where applicable, surrounding communities. 
Further fatality risk control interventions were identified and will 
be implemented as a priority in the year ahead and safety  
metrics are being embedded in the performance targets of 
employees and management.

HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMITTEE CONTINUED

•  The company continues to monitor the safety aspects of its 
sustainability performance including the management of air 
quality, water, effluent and waste and as discussed elsewhere,  
is in the process of significantly strengthening its data capturing 
and management processes in this regard. We are pleased to 
report an 8.8% decreased in the company’s carbon emissions 
and a 23% improvement in water efficiency, aided to some 
extent by good rains in some of our regions. 

•  The company’s comprehensive safety programmes, employee 
and community-focused health initiatives and environmental 
stewardship are covered in detail in the social capital and 
natural capital elements of this report.

SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING
Significant effort went into the improvement of ESG management 
in Tongaat Hulett in the past year. This included the development 
and implementation of a new Sustainability Management 
framework, a review of all SHE policies, procedures, systems 
and controls, driving the development of a sustainability data 
management system which will include the training and 
development for the SHE teams at each operation to manage the 
increasingly complex nature of ESG management and reporting. 
To improve upon the reliability and comparability of  
Tongaat Hulett’s sustainability data, internal audit reviews  
of site-specific information will be conducted. The group’s 
sustainability data is also certified by an independent  
third-party assurance provider on an annual basis. 

In the context of these changes: 

•  The Committee considered and approved a group Sustainability 

Management framework as the cornerstone of the company’s 
approach to ESG management and reporting.

•  The Committee considered and approved a range of ESG 

policies including the Responsible Sugar Consumption policy.  
A Responsible Agri-Chemical Use policy and Sustainable 
Property policy are also in the process of being developed  
and approved.

•  The Climate Change policy, Land Use policy and Sustainable 

Sugar policy were considered by the Committee and 
recommended to the Board for approval.

•  Tongaat Hulett published its first Climate Change Report to 

articulate progress made towards improving carbon and water 
efficiencies. The Committee reviewed and approved the group’s 
first set of comprehensive efficiency targets.

•  The Committee, as part of its role of assisting the Board to 

achieve better performance on sustainability matters, reviewed 
and accepted the 2021 ESG and Climate Change Report.  
To ensure the reliability and consistency of information,  
the Committee considered the sustainability and governance 
information as disclosed in the company’s Integrated Annual 
Report and ESG and Climate Change Report as well as 
applicable reports from the external assurance providers, BDO.  
The independence of the ESG and Climate Change Report 
assurance provider was also assessed and confirmed.

GOOD CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
Tongaat Hulett has a proud history of partnering with surrounding 
communities, governments and other stakeholders to support 
the sustainable development of the communities within which 
we operate. The company’s SED programmes incorporate 
and contribute towards the achievement of the SDGs and are 
customised for each of the locality, based on the unique need  
of those communities. 

•  The Committee monitored the company’s commitment to 

being a responsible corporate citizen. The company continues 
to demonstrate responsibility to society by extending 
philanthropic and charitable initiatives to communities 
surrounding our operations. Despite the urgent need to reduce 
costs and repay debt, SED spend was increased by 39% to 
R122.4 million in 2021, with c. R100 million of that directed at 
health-related activities, given current pressing needs. 

•  The strategic importance of the company’s SED contribution 

and examples of recent achievements are described in the 
Social and Relationship Capital section of the report.

•  The Committee approved the company’s proposal to re-join  

the UNGC.

•  The Stakeholder Relationship Management policy was 

considered by the Committee and recommended to the Board 
for approval. The Committee also monitored the company’s 
standing and assessed its proactive stakeholder engagement 
interface to ensure the maintenance of strong and effective 
stakeholder relationships. This included a comprehensive 
stakeholder reputation survey to gauge perceptions from 
our stakeholders concerning our efforts to rebuild trust. 
The Committee is pleased with the significantly improved 
reputational scores across all stakeholders in the  
Reputational survey.

•  The company is committed to economic sustainability and 

continues to assess its business approach to responsible 
strategic sourcing, empowerment and preferential 
procurement, considering employment equity,  
skills development and B-BBEE within the Southern African 
context. The company is committed to meeting B-BBEE 
requirements in South Africa and annually conducts a B-BBEE 
audit assessment through 1st Verification Networx,  
an accredited institution. Significant strides have been made to 
ensure that a Level 2 B-BBEE rating was achieved in the  
coming period. 
        

The company’s B-BBEE rating scorecard and certificate are 
available on the website.

•  Tongaat Hulett adheres to the ten principles articulated in 
the UNGC to promote sustainable development and good 
corporate citizenship, through a set of values based on 
universally accepted principles. The Committee is satisfied that 
the principles continue to receive appropriate attention from 
the company.

led by the company and the positive impact on stakeholder 
engagement can be found under the Social and Relationship

ASSURANCE STATEMENT

Assessment Standard
The assurance process was conducted in line with the requirements of AccountAbility’s AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS, 2008)  
Type 1 assurance.
The work was planned and carried out to provide moderate, rather than absolute/high assurance.
Summary of work performed
As part of its independent assurance, BDO undertook the following activities:
• 
•  Review of documentary evidence produced by Tongaat Hulett.
•  Audit of data on a sample basis, the data was traced back to the source using data analytics and manual review.
•  Review of Tongaat Hulett’s data and information systems for collection, aggregation, analysis, and review.
Conclusions
Based on our methodology and the activities described above, it is our opinion that:

Interviews with relevant personnel at different sites of Tongaat Hulett.

•  The subject matter information included in the report are accurate and free from material mistake or misstatement to the group.
•  The subject matter information provides a fair representation of Tongaat Hulett’s activities over the reporting period.

inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness in its operations.

Alignment with the principles of AA1000AS (2018)
Inclusivity
Tongaat Hulett has processes in place for engaging with a range of key stakeholders, including employees, members, suppliers, providers, 
and community partners.
Through discussion and review of reports, we can conclude that Tongaat Hulett conducted several formal stakeholder engagement 
activities in 2020 covering a range of topics of which some are included in the indicators being assured.
Covid-19 testing, provision of PPE and counselling were some of the engagements provided by Tongaat Hulett regarding the pandemic 
and ensuring health and safety of its employees.
Materiality
The report addresses the range of social, environmental, and economic issues of concern that Tongaat Hulett has identified as being of 
highest material importance.
BDO was not part of the materiality assessment, however, discussions with management indicated that the indicators assured were part of 
the risk and opportunities identified by the business. The identification of material issues considered both internal assessments of risks and 
opportunities to the business, as well as stakeholders views and concerns.
Responsiveness
Tongaat Hulett is responding to the issues it has identified as material and these are validated in the organisational objectives, indicators, 
and performance targets that are reported in a transparent manner. The reported information can be used by the organisation and its 
stakeholders as a reasonable basis for their opinions and decision-making.
Impact
Tongaat Hulett monitors and measures its activities that affect the social, economic, and environmental aspects. These are reported and 
assured independently and in a transparent manner. The report also indicates the impact that Tongaat Hulett activities have on the broader 
ecosystem and mitigation plans on how to improve processes and reduce their impact.
Note of independence, impartiality, and competence

No member of the assurance team has a business relationship with Tongaat Hulett, its Directors or Managers beyond that required of this 
assignment. We conducted this assurance assignment independently and to our knowledge, there has been no conflict of interest.
The assurance team has experience in conducting assurance over non-financial information, systems, and processes. The team understands 
the standard methodology for the assurance of sustainability reporting required by Tongaat Hulett.
