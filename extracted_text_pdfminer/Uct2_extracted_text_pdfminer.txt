COUNCIL STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

LEGAL PERSONA AND CAPACITY
The  University  is  autonomous  and  is  a  legal  persona  with  full  juristic  capacity  by  virtue  of  its 
incorporation as a university (originally by an Act of the Union Parliament of 1916 when Parliament 
incorporated  the  South  African  College,  and  now  in  terms  of  the  Higher  Education  Act,  1997 
(the  Act)  and  the  Institutional  Statute  of  the  University  of  Cape  Town  published  under  that  Act). 
This legislation places the governance of the University in the hands of a Council, provides for the 
Council’s composition and powers, and provides for the role and powers of the Senate and the role 
and functions of the Institutional Forum.

THE COUNCIL AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES 
PROVIDED FOR IN THE ACT
The University of Cape Town grew out of the South African College, which had been established 
in 1829. The institution became a University in 1918 under a 1916 Act of the Union Parliament. That, 
and successive legislation, gave way to the Higher Education Act, No. 101 of 1997 (the Act), and the 
promulgation in terms of the Act of the Institutional Statute of the University of Cape Town (under 
government notice No. 1199 of 20 September 2002 and as subsequently amended). The Act deals 
inter alia with public higher education institutions, of which the University is one.

The Act requires a public higher 
education institution to have a 
Council, a Senate, a structure to 
advise the Council on student 
matters, an Institutional Forum, and 
a Students’ Representative Council.

The Act, read with the Institutional 
Statute, defines the role, powers and 
composition of each of these bodies.

The Act requires a public higher education 
institution  to  have  a  Council,  a  Senate,  
a  structure  to  advise  the  Council  on 
student  matters,  an  Institutional  Forum, 
and  a  Students’  Representative  Council. 
The Act, read with the Institutional Statute, 
defines  the  role,  powers  and  composition 
of each of these bodies.
The  Council  governs 
the  University 
in  terms  of  the  Act  and  the  Statute.  
It consists of not more than 30 members, 
of whom 60% are external or independent 
(in that none may be a student nor a staff 
member).  The  term  of  office  (other  than 
for  the  student  members  who  serve  for 
one  year,  and  the  Vice-Chancellor  who 
serves ex officio) is four years.

While the Council governs the University, the Senate has jurisdiction over the academic functions 
of the University. The Senate consists of all professors, all heads of academic departments, elected 
academic  and  support  staff,  members  appointed  by  the  UCT  Nominations  Committee  from  the 
academic  departments,  elected  student  members  and  co-opted  members.  Much  of  the  work 
of  Senate  is  done  by  the  Faculty  Boards  (UCT  has  six  faculties,  a  centre  for  higher  education 
development and a business school) and by committees of the Senate.
The  Institutional  Forum  brings  together  ten  student  members  (in  a  body  of  30)  chosen  by  the 
Students’ Representative Council, ten staff members chosen by trade unions and staff bodies, and ten 
members  representing  Council,  Senate  and  executive  leadership.  It  advises  the  Council  on  issues 
affecting the University as required by the Act.
The Council is supported by specialist committees and working groups.
The  matters  reserved  for  decision  by  full  Council  are  those  specified  in  the  Act  (changes  to  the 
Institutional Statute, adopting institutional rules, acquiring or disposing of fixed property, setting fees, 
and  specified  financial  transactions),  those  listed  in  the  Institutional  Statute  (paragraph  12(5)),  and 
matters that Council has reserved to itself. Beyond this, Council has powers of delegation and has 
made use of these powers to delegate or assign some of its powers and functions to a committee 
of  Council,  a  member  of  Council,  or  an  officer  of  the  University  (paragraph  12(4)  of  the  Statute). 
Schedules of delegated authority are reviewed annually by Council.
The Council as currently constituted complies with the requirements of the law. Members of Council 
are not remunerated. Should a Council member need to travel outside Cape Town, or to Cape Town 
to attend a meeting, however, s/he may be reimbursed for the travel expenses incurred.

ETHICS IN DECISION-MAKING AND IN UNIVERSITY WORK
The Council is committed to behaving ethically and with integrity in all its dealings.
Care is taken to ensure that:
 » the University complies with the governance prescripts contained in the Act and the Institutional 

Statute;

 » the mandates of committees are clear, written, consistent with the legislation and adhered to;
 » full  records  are  kept  of  the  proceedings  of  Council,  Senate,  the  Institutional  Forum  and  their 

applicable committees; and

 » where decisions are made under delegated authority the written authority limits are not exceeded.
In order to ensure that there is neither an actual nor a perceived conflict of interest, and that decisions 
are  made  independently  of  the  personal  interests  of  members,  each  Council  member,  all  senior 
managers, and all members of Council committees are required: (i) to make an annual declaration of 
interests; (ii) to declare any conflict or potential conflict ahead of discussion of relevant issues; and (iii) 
to recuse themselves should any such conflict of interest arise. In addition, all Council members must 
subscribe to the Council’s code on conflicts (or potential conflicts) of interest, as well as the Council 
code of conduct. The latter was updated in 2021.
The Ombud’s Office represents a further step to ensure fairness in all institutional dealings with staff, 
students and third parties, and to promote probity.

COUNCIL STATEMENT ON CORPORATE 
GOVERNANCE Continued

ETHICS IN DECISION-MAKING AND IN 
UNIVERSITY WORK Continued
In  addition,  a  whistle-blower  hotline  which  has  been  in  operation  since  2015  has  been  managed 
externally  through  Whistleblowers  Inc.  since  2018.  Allegations  of  fraud,  corruption,  or  unethical 
conduct may be reported confidentially and anonymously.
Corporate  governance  and  ethics  in  decision-making  are  further  reinforced  by  the  University’s 
statement of values1, updated in December 2016, and the Fraud and Corruption Prevention Policy2.

STAKEHOLDERS
UCT is a diverse community, located within a wider context of multiple stakeholder groups on whom 
UCT relies and who have expectations of the University in terms of its mission, actions and decisions. 
The  University’s  stakeholder  network  includes,  inter  alia,  academic  partners,  staff  (academic  and 
professional),  students,  government  agencies,  the  private  sector,  civil  society  groups,  parents, 
funders, and the media. These relationships are valued and nurtured at various levels in the institution. 
For example, this is done via the Executive with government agencies, via the faculties and research 
units with research partners, via the Development and Alumni Department with donors, alumni and 
members of Convocation, with schools and parents via the Student Admissions Office, with staff 
members  via  the  representative  bodies  and  consultative  forums,  with  students  via  the  SRC  and 
other student formations, with the media via the Executive and the Department of Communication 
and  Marketing,  and  with  civil  society  groupings  through  the  work  of  the  University  in  its  social 
responsiveness and community engagement endeavours.

THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL
The Council’s key responsibilities are to ensure that:
 » The University has clear strategic goals and objectives.
 » The  Executive  Officers  (the  Vice-Chancellor,  Deputy  Vice-Chancellors  and  Chief  Operating 

Officer) are held to account in achieving the University’s goals and objectives.

 » The University’s financial position is sound in the short- and long-term.
 » No fees are set, and no financial appropriations made, without Council approval.
 » Risk management and internal controls are in place.
 » All the University’s members (staff, students, and alumni), donors, clients, and suppliers are treated 

in an appropriate manner.

 » The University complies with relevant laws, regulations and accounting policies.
The  committees  and  sub-committees  necessary  to  achieve  the  above  are  in  place,  are  properly 
constituted and have appropriate terms of reference and reporting procedures.

OBJECTIVES FOR THE COUNCIL FOR 2021
The Chair of Council is required to report annually on the work of the Council. The Auditor General 
requires  that  the  Council  report  on  the  extent  to  which  the  Council  has  met  its  pre-determined 
objectives for the year. The reporting regulations as published in the Gazette of 9 June 2014 under 
Government Notice No. R.464 are designed for reporting against such pre-determined objectives. A 
key part of this is the Annual Performance Plan. Having regard to this, and its responsibilities under 
the Act and the Statute, the Council (at its meeting of 5 December 2020) set the following high-level 
objectives for 2021.

Table 1: Objectives for the Council for 2021
Council objectives related to predetermined objectives and statutory oversight follows below:

Council authorised for 
submission to the Department 
of Higher Education  
(a) the 2020 Annual Report 
in June 2021; (b) the 2021 
Mid-year Performance 
Report in December 2021; 
and (c) the 2022 Annual 
Performance Plan in 
December 2021.

Education and Training as they relate to the annual cycle of 
planning and reporting as follows:
a.  The 2020 Annual Report
b.  The 2021 Mid-year Performance Report
c.  The 2022 Annual Performance Plan

To achieve the approved enrolment targets for 2021, as well 
as the graduate output and throughput targets.
UCT’s enrolment planning compact with the Ministry and the 
Department  of  Higher  Education  and  Training  required  that 
UCT achieve a headcount enrolment of 28 174 (2020: 28 037) 
students in 2021. This agreed target total can be broken down 
as  follows:  16  456  (2019:  16  421)  undergraduate  students, 
3 008 (2020: 2 988) postgraduates below the master’s level, 
5  150  (2020:  5  087)  master’s  students  and  2  073  (2020: 
2  053)  doctoral  enrolments.    The  headcount  enrolment  is 
projected  to  translate  into  21  426  (2020:  21  322)  full-time 
equivalent enrolments.

COUNCIL’S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Council is supported by a standing Executive Committee (EXCO) to which Council has delegated 
specific formal decision-making functions. Council meets at least four times each year and EXCO 
meets regularly between February and November, generally in those months in which Council does 
not meet.
The EXCO consists of the Chair and Deputy Chair of Council, the Chair of the University Finance 
Committee (UFC), four additional members of Council (two of whom must be external members and 
one of whom must be a student member) and the Vice-Chancellor.
The table below sets out the number of EXCO meetings held in 2021 and each member’s attendance

REPORT ON 2021 EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES

INTRODUCTION
The Council of the University of Cape Town at its meeting of June 2020 affirmed the future strategic 
planning framework for the university as presented in the document entitled: Vision 2030: Unleash 
human potential to create a fair and just society.
Through Vision 2030 the university seeks to “draw from the extraordinary social and cultural 
diversity,  creativity  and  capacity  for  innovation  of  all  our  staff  and  students  to  contribute 
to  making  the  21st  century  the  Afrikan  century;  to  look  at  ourselves  as  a  university  and 
create  together  the  top  global  university  in  Afrika  –  a  university  that  is  uncompromising  in 
its  transformative  intent,  deeply  rooted  in  academic  excellence  and  that  strives  for  social, 
environmental and financial sustainability”.
Transformation  constitutes  one  of  the  Vice-Chancellor’s  pillars  to  build  the  future  of  UCT.  Thus 
our commitment to transformation forms a constitutive part of the core academic functions of the 
university as much as of the professional and administrative services that make the delivery of our 
mission possible. From an operational perspective the University of Cape Town has a transformation 
and student affairs portfolio managed by a Deputy Vice-Chancellor. Vision 2030 was conceptualised 
as an integrated strategy in which the different sections and units of the university work towards 
achieving objectives which together contribute to the realisation of the vision while each executive 
takes primary responsibility for specific projects.
Unleashing human potential to create a fair and just society is the massive transformative purpose 
that will drive UCT for the next 10 years. In order to achieve this, UCT identified four goals:

1
 
L

G

To develop and foster an 
organisational ethos that 
supports new ways of

University of Cape Town Annual Report 2021 13

www.uct.ac.zaThe 2021 Executive objectives related to Research solving Afrika’s problems goal were to:
 » Develop the next generation of researchers and scholars.
 » Expand access and funding for senior postgraduate students.
 » Increase diversity and inclusivity among students registered for postgraduate research degrees.
 » Identify interventions to increase postgraduate throughput.
 » Improve research management and support systems.
 » Support research focused on the SDGs.
It has to be noted that the COVID-19 pandemic that began in March 2020 became the all-encompassing 
context within which the UCT executive was developing Vision 2030, while ensuring the continuity 
of the teaching and learning and research operations under different levels of lockdown. The detail of 
the work done by UCT to run the academic project, the teaching and learning and research functions 
under COVID-19 will be reflected on in the Senate Reports section of this document. Suffice it to say 
here that the University was able to move swiftly into Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) for both 
undergraduate  and  postgraduate  programmes  and  that  arrangements  were  made  to  maintain  the 
continuity of the research enterprise in critical areas that required physical presence in laboratories. 
The decision to move into ERT as well as the modality chosen to do so were informed by a survey 
of  student  ability  to  access  the  internet,  data  and  devices.  Throughout  2020  and  2021,  UCT 
monitored student engagement online and put in place different forms of support to facilitate student 
performance in ERT and subsequently during Physically Distant Learning (PDL). Like all other public 
universities during 2020 and 2021, UCT has been providing the Department of Higher Education and 
Training with regular reports on its management of the academic project, staff, students and finances 
during the pandemic. Full reports on how UCT managed teaching and learning and research during 
COVID-19 in 2021, will serve in Senate in the second semester of 2022.

REPORT ON 2021 EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES 
Continued

This set of high-level goals required the development of lower-level objectives for each of them in 
order to realise Vision 2030. The development of these objectives will be ongoing and iterative in 
nature and will change over time as different milestones are achieved.
The executive objectives presented in the 2021 Annual Performance Plan that preceded this report 
bridged the development of Vision 2030 and its full implementation which will take place in phases. 
During 2021 UCT planned specifically to embark on the implementation of the foundational projects 
of Vision 2030, that is those projects on which future developments will be built and which UCT will 
report on in subsequent versions of this report.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

UCT Vision 2030: #Unleash Executive Objectives
The  executive  objectives  identified  as  priorities  during  2021  respond  to  three  key  issues  that 
emerged  during  the  wide-ranging  engagements  across  the  university  during  the  developmental 
phase of the strategy. The first of these was the centrality of transformation and a transformed 
way  of  thinking,  being  and  doing  in  the  creation  of  a  conducive  environment  to  realise  Vision 
2030.  The  second  key  issue  driving  strategic  implementation  was  the  need  for  collaboration 
and  clear  communication  between  and  within  senior  executive  portfolios  providing  for 
the  opportunity  for  innovation  and  creativity  in  tackling  problems.  The  third  key  issue  was  the 
identification  of  foundational  projects  required  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  Vision  2030.  
The  executive  objectives  for  2021  articulated  below  represent  an  opportunity  to  put  into  place 
the  initial  pre-requisites  and  mechanisms  that  would  create  the  foundation  for  the  success  of  
Vision 2030.
The following 2021 Executive objectives related to the Organisational ethos that supports new 
ways of thinking, being and doing and to provide thought leadership on social justice goals:
 » Implementation  of  the  accelerated  transformation  plan  (demographic  and  institutional  cultural 

transformation).

 » Redress inequality and build social justice through targeted strategies.
 » Support community engaged research.
The  2021  Executive  objectives  related  to  the  Offering  a  holistic,  innovative,  future-oriented 
education goal were as follows:
 » Increase the utilisation of data analytics in teaching and learning.
 » Support the development of academic teaching and learning skills.
 » Develop a plan to offer digitally mediated education.
 » Implement the guidelines for curriculum review at undergraduate level.

Objective 1 –  Implementation of the accelerated transformation plan (demographic 

and institutional cultural transformation).

UCT  has  been  addressing  the  challenge  of  increasing  the  number  of  black  South  African 
academics on its academic staff for at least the last ten years. Despite these systemic efforts, 
progress  has  been  slow,  with  the  designated  groups  (including  black  South  Africans,  women  and 
persons with disability) still under-represented at the level of associate professor and professor.
An  Action  Plan  for  Accelerated  Transformation  at  UCT  (which  served  at  the  October  2020 
Council Meeting) flowed from the recently published Report from the Ministerial Task Team on the 
recruitment,  retention  and  progression  of  black  South  African  academic  staff;  conversations  that 
the Vice-Chancellor had with stakeholders to better understand specific barriers; and a request by 
Council  for  a  plan  that  speaks  to  the  identification  of  current  gaps  in  transformation  and  ways  to 
address them. The action plan focuses on the need to accelerate the recruitment of black South 
African staff, in particular, at the level of the professoriate. It also acknowledges the need to attract 
and retain black South African postgraduate students to feed into a pipeline to be considered for 
academic positions. Improving the throughput rate of black South African postgraduate students is 
an important part of the plan to accelerate transformation: the Action Plan focuses on the need to 
ensure that all black South African postgraduate students graduate within the allocated timeline for 
their degrees, to facilitate access into an academic career and the economy more broadly. This will 
require dedicated and focused support. The plan includes two key components: (1) the expansion of 
the VC employment equity fund; and (2) an academic pipeline programme and enhanced support to 
ensure career progression for black South African academics.

UCT officially launched its Accelerated Transformation of the Academic Programme (ATAP) initiative 
in  mid-October  2021  via  a  virtual  event  at  which  various  UCT  staff  members,  including  the  Vice-
Chancellor (VC), spoke about the potential the programme could unlock in the students involved. 
Aimed at developing and supporting a cohort of high-performing black South African postgraduate 
students and postdoctoral fellows with an interest in pursuing academic careers, the ATAP is intended 
to widen the pool of black South African candidates available for academic positions at UCT and 
other institutions.
ATAP evolved out of a reflection on the part of black professors and associate professors suggesting 
ways in which UCT could accelerate such transformation. The Programme thus focuses on providing 
full  financial  support  to  selected  high-performing  black  postgraduates  and  monitors  development 
opportunities while offering mentoring by academics of the participants’ choice.

UCT officially launched its Accelerated Transformation of the Academic 
Programme (ATAP) initiative in mid-October 2021 via a virtual event at 
which various UCT staff members, including the Vice-Chancellor (VC), 
spoke about the potential the programme could unlock in the students 
involved.

The  programme,  which  was  piloted  in  2021,  is  managed  through  the  office  of  the  
Deputy Vice-Chancellor: Transformation. It represents an initial investment of R44 million from UCT 
Council investments into a seven-year initiative that will run from January 2022 to December 2026. 
The programme aims to enhance opportunities for young and outstanding scholars, strengthening 
career pathing while contributing to the transformation of academia. The programme is driven by 
the  Deputy  Vice  Chancellor  for  Research  and  Internationalisation  and  has  links  to  the  Centre  for 
Higher Education Development (CHED) to the office of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Teaching and 
Learning, as well as to UCT’s Office for Inclusivity & Change.
By instituting this programme, UCT is providing a nurturing environment that will produce a critical 
mass of the next generation of black South African academics. The initiative emanates from UCT’s 
transformation  vision;  in  particular,  from  the  perspective  of  accelerating  the  transformation  of 
academia. While UCT has long recognised the importance of capacity-building and training with a 
view to transforming the current and future academic sector and there are thus several initiatives (such 
as the New Generation of Academics Programme – nGAP, and the Next Generation Professoriate – 
NGP) there was clearly a need to further invest in and accelerate the transformation of the academic 
programme at UCT.
The official launch of the programme and the recognition of its first cohort represented a significant 
milestone towards not only the practical wrap-around support and mentoring of black South African 
master’s and doctoral students and post-doctoral fellows, but also in terms of UCT’s Vision 2030, 
which is anchored in three pillars: excellence, transformation and sustainability.

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES FOR 2021 Continued

Objective 2 –  Redress inequality and build social justice through targeted 

strategies

In 2021, for the third successive year, UCT employed transformation benchmarks to measure 
how well the university has integrated, responded to and actioned transformation, inclusion 
and  diversity.  The  benchmarks  fall  into  nine  categories,  each  of  which  asks  how  the  university 
has  practised  transformation  in  the  previous  12-month  period  and  are  assessed  in  the  university’s 
annual  Transformation  Report.  The  benchmarks  specifically  generate  refection  on  (among  others) 
how  the  university  has  strategically  integrated  transformation,  how  the  university  supports  the 
access  and  success  of  students  and  staff  from  diverse  and  disparate  backgrounds,  how  it  affirms 
dignity  and  acknowledges  diversity  through  spaces  and  places  (such  as  building  names,  symbols 
and artworks) and how the institution responds to discrimination, harassment and violence. Because 
the three years that these benchmarks reflect on have been so diverse, the results are not directly  
employed  to  track  progress,  but  rather  to  assist  the  university  to  define  its  areas  of  strength,  
gaps and thematic areas that can inform future strategy.
On average, 13 entities (or units) at UCT submitted reports against the benchmarks between 2019 
and  2021.  Despite  a  number  of  challenges,  the  approach  used  showed  specific  trends  that  could 
inform the priorities and practices of the university. Overall, in 2021, every faculty and several non-
academic departments reported actions that enabled staff and student access, support and success. 
This included ensuring that students had access to psychosocial and education support and focused 
on  diversifying  both  student  and  staff  demographics.  Faculties  and  departments  also  reported 
actions that supported staff development and growth, and that focused on UCT’s African identity 
(and responded to racism). Some benchmark areas, including the focus on space, place, language 
and identity, reported fewer actions in 2021; this is not surprising given the low-density campus that 
persisted in the second year of the COVID-19 epidemic.
With regard to the benchmark on the “Strategic Integration of Transformation” a range of specific 
actions  were  reported  and  included  the  strengthening  of  transformation  capacities  through  hiring 
or identifying designated transformation officers/experts or specialists; strengthened transformation 
governance  structures;  and  hosting  or  facilitating  unit-wide  engagements  on  race,  gender  and 
sexuality. It was recognised that adequate resourcing of these initiatives is essential for optimal impact.

In terms of “Student Access, Support and Success” it was recognised that the focus in 2021 was on 
the shift to emergency online teaching (ERT), and subsequently physically distant learning (PDL), and 
that this led to a focus on the parity of participation, rather than on ensuring, centring and critically 
engaging  with  issues  related  to  transformation,  inclusivity  and  diversity.  Student  demographics 
are  routinely  tracked  and  reported  on  (see  Section  2  below).  In  2021,  a  wide  range  of  student 
support activities were reported, in response to the specific challenges facing students during the 
lockdown and remote learning. These unit responses included offering psychosocial and education 
support  which  was  sensitive  to  socio-economic,  racial  and  other  disparities  (CHED and  DSA);  the 
development  of  digital  resources  and  tools  for  students  (Commerce  and  GSB);  consolidating  and 
connecting institutional and faculty student support efforts (Humanities and Law); creating student-
led events for learning and reflection on transformation and heritage (IAPO); ongoing psychosocial 
and other support through the DSA for students in residence, student societies and students more 
broadly; specific support for students with disabilities, students experiencing sexual or gender-based 
violence or other forms of discrimination, harassment and violence through the Office of Inclusivity 
& Change (OIC); and the development of mechanisms for students to directly raise concerns with 
faculties or departments about issues they were facing.
In relation to the benchmark “Staff Access, Support and Success”, the 2021 report indicated that most 
departments and faculties track their staff demographic profiles and that many engaged with staff 
on diversity and provided psychosocial support to staff in response to the stress and trauma of the 
COVID-19 period. The shift to remote working provided particular challenges in relation to engaging 
with  staff  and  welcoming  new  colleagues.  In  response  to  this  benchmark,  many  units  reported 
referring  black  and  women  staff  to  leadership,  academic  and  research  development  programmes. 
Several units reported that committees and decision-making bodies in their areas were diverse in 
terms of race and gender but included few persons with disabilities. Many units also reported hosting 
workshops, discussions or learning events on specific topics including race, gender and sexuality. A 
particular example of good practice cited was the Next Generation Leadership Programme, initiated 
by  CHED,  that  enables  mid-career  staff  to  participate  in  leadership  development  in  a  programme 
that  overtly  takes  account  of  the  social  context  of  leadership  in  international  and  African  Higher 
Education. Also during 2021, the OIC ran over 100 distinct workshops reaching an estimated 2 000 
staff members across the university through its inclusivity capacity building, institutional culture and 
disability  portfolios  on  issues  related  to  inclusivity,  diversity  and  transformation.  These  workshops 
dealt  with  themes  including  staff  values;  examples  of  racism,  disability  colonialism  and  gender 
inequality; and co-creating a transformation vision for entities within the university.

Overall, in 2021, every faculty and several non-academic departments 
reported actions that enabled staff and student access, support and 
success.

Continued

Objective 3 – Support community engaged research

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES FOR 2021 Continued
In terms of the benchmark dealing with “Place and Space: Language, Names, Symbols, Artworks 
and Identity” several working groups and committees contributed to this benchmark including the 
Language  Policy  Working  Group;  the  work  of  the  Multilingualism  Education  Project;  the  Naming 
of Buildings Committee; and Works of Art Collection (WOAC) committee. These committees and 
working groups ensure the use of language at UCT, the names on buildings and the artworks on 
campus  are  relevant  to  marginalised  groups  and  respond  to  their  realities.  For  example,  in  2021: 
many  units,  focused  on  language  and  linguistic  inclusion  through  supporting  students  who  aren’t 
first  language  English  speakers  or  through  offering  content  and  courses  on  indigenous  and  local 
languages;  the  Faculty  of  Law  listed  the  Land  and  Accountability  Research  Centre  and  Centre 
for  Law  and  Society  as  sites  of  knowledge  production  which  contribute  towards  this  benchmark; 
UCT  Libraries  created  a  digital  platform  called  Ibali  (the  isiXhosa  word  for  story)  which  makes 
connections  between  and  showcases  collections  dealing  with  indigenous  histories  and  social 
issues (such as climate change). Also during 2021, the Naming of Buildings Committee established a  
sub-committee to chart the way forward in relation to the proposed renaming of the former Smuts 
Hall Residence. The residence has been named Upper Campus Residence in the interim. The Senate 
Language  Policy  Committee  (SLPC)  started  introducing  and  unpacking  the  new  Language  Policy 
Framework to faculties and developed a short briefing document for this purpose. The SLPC also 
undertook  a  mapping  exercise  that  captured  the  use  of  multilingual  pedagogies  and  interventions 
within faculties at the institution. The Works of Art Committee focused on the development of a 
new  curatorial  policy  that  would  ensure  public  access,  demonstrate  leadership  on  transformation, 
inclusion and social justice, prioritise research and education efforts and ensure accountability and the 
transformation of learning spaces.

Since 2010 the UCT Knowledge Co-op has been developing long-term 
relationships with local non-profits and interest groups.

Social  responsiveness  is  supported  through  a  variety  of  initiatives  at  UCT.  Perhaps  most 
importantly,  UCT’s  Social  Responsiveness  Committee  has,  since  2003,  overseen  the  annual 
compilation  of  a  Social  Responsiveness  Report  to  Senate  and  Council,  highlighting  how  the 
university  tackles  social,  economic,  cultural  and  political  needs.  Appropriately,  the  most  recent 
(2020–2021)  Social  Responsiveness  Report  was  COVID-19  themed,  providing  an  account 
of  the  wide  array  of  activities  that  the  UCT  community  was  engaged  in,  in  response  to  the 
pandemic  crises.  The  contents  of  this  report  are  described  more  fully  on  pages  39–48  below  
(in Section 4: the Senate Reports section of this document).
UCT  established  an  Engaged  Scholarship  Programme  in  2015,  providing  a  space  for  professional 
development  for  staff  who  wish  to  embed  high  quality  engagement  into  their  research  
and/or teaching, and who have an interest in exploring the transformative possibilities of engaged 
scholarship. The programme comprises four interactive seminars and a workshop, interspersed with 
preparatory  readings,  reflective  writing  and  practical  applications.  Experienced  engaged  scholars 
from UCT lead the seminars or present aspects of their work for critical consideration. The seminar 
series begins with the “Here and Now” (exploring what kinds of engaged scholarship participants are 
currently involved in, and in what ways, if at all, their work articulates with UCT’s policy for engaged 
scholarship. The importance of engaged scholarship in UCT’s current context and for the changing 
higher education landscape in South Africa and the continent is also explored). The seminars then 
move on to considering case studies of practice; quality criteria for engaged scholarship; approaches 
to theorisation; the challenges of activist scholarship in a university setting; and tensions in purpose, 
rationale and the relationship of engaged scholarship to university missions and practices of scholarly 
recognition. In addition to the seminars, there are several independent activities, all of them integral to 
the programme, including reading, writing, small group collaboration and an assignment for presentation 
in the final seminar. Between 2015 and 2020 the programme “graduated” 115 academics, researchers 
and postgraduate students.
Since  2010  the  UCT  Knowledge  Co-op  has  been  developing  long-term  relationships  with  local 
non-profits  and  interest  groups.  These  groups  share  questions  arising  from  their  work,  and  the 
Co-op advertises those that lend themselves to student dissertations in the appropriate academic 
departments. Graduate students then develop their research proposals around such topics and the 
Co-op facilitates the collaborative process with the community partner, ensuring that the resulting 
process fulfils both community and academic requirements.
The  work  of  the  Knowledge  Co-op  is  particularly  relevant  to  UCT’s  Vision  2030  goal  to 
“unleash  knowledge  in  and  from  Afrika”  as  it  offers  postgraduate  researchers  an  opportunity  to 
benefit from participating in situational research in “real life” contexts and to make a contribution to 
the challenges experienced there.

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES FOR 2021 Continued
In  2021,  60  new  Knowledge  Co-op  project  topics  were  sourced  from  18  community  partners. 
One  partner  (Khulisa  Social  Solutions)  has  submitted  23  topics  in  the  more  than  six  years  of 
partnering,  resulting  in  six  dissertations  to  date.  34  research  collaborations  between  students  and 
community  groups  were  facilitated  during  the  year.  These  include  23  master’s  projects,  five  at 
honours level and six undergraduate research reports. Topics ranged from studying the impact of 
involvement in a dog-handling and life skills programme on participating children, to the governance 
of  homelessness  in  Cape  Town;  they  involve  producing  stories  of  empowerment  for  survivors  of 
intimate partner violence or advice for an electronic system to collate programme statistics. Students 
in the Commerce faculty contributed the greatest number of projects (19), with 13 projects involving 
Humanities students and a few in Science and Health Sciences.
UCT  established  an  annual  Social  Responsiveness  Award  in  2009.  The  award  recognises  UCT 
academics who demonstrate how social engagement can enhance the teaching and learning process 
– one of the university’s priorities. At least one award has been made each year (with the exception 
of  2016)  to  a  wide  diversity  of  individuals  und  groupings  across  the  university.  Most  recently,  the 
2021 award was made to Professor Leslie London in the Faculty of Health Sciences, recognising his 
contribution to achieving social justice in healthcare in South Africa. Professor London is dedicated 
to  prioritising  vulnerable  communities  and  empowering  them  to  speak  up  to  improve  the  quality 
of  healthcare  in  South  Africa.  He  has  worked  with  a  variety  of  marginalised  communities,  health 
committee members and civil society activists in South Africa and abroad.

To offer a holistic, innovative, future-oriented education

Objective 1 – Increase the use of data analytics in teaching and learning

UCT’s Data Analytics for Student Success (DASS) is a three-year project launched in January 
2020,  with  the  goal  of  building  institutional  capabilities  to  harness  the  power  of  data  for 
actionable  insights  that  support  student  success.  The  project  draws  on  expertise  from  CHED, 
ICTS and the IPD and is governed by the Data Analytics for Student Success Committee (DASSC), 
a  subcommittee  of  the  Senate  Teaching  and  Learning  Committee.  DASSC  is  responsible  for  the 
development of an institutional strategy for student success using data analytics and oversees its 
implementation through the DASS Project.
The project focuses on tracking student performance over time across programmes, with a view to 
identifying key “blockages” and thereby addressing the critical issue of attrition. Within the climate 
of enormous uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the project leveraged the power of 
data and analytics to provide real-time insights that proved invaluable to university leadership tasked 
with supporting students to rapidly make the shift from traditional pedagogy to Emergency Remote 
Teaching and Physically Distanced Learning (PDL).
Prior  to  the  pandemic,  work  in  data  analytics  had  been  circumscribed  to  a  handful  of  courses 
impeding  graduation.  Under  COVID-19,  the  DASS  project  extended  its  work  to  all  courses,  
with  more  than  20  student  enrolments,  showing  the  potential  of  using  appropriate  data  
visualisation to monitor, understand, and manage student performance.
DASS identified the following two strategic goals during 2020, focusing on student success at the 
course  and  programme  level  respectively:  adoption  by  Heads  of  Department  (HoDs)  and  course 
convenors of data analytics and visualisations to understand and support their students’ performance; 
and using academic plans and programmes as the unit of analysis to identify where student progress 
is being impeded.
DASS undertook the following in relation to data analytics and reporting during 2021:
 » The project continued to maintain the dashboard of online student participation originally created 
for Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) in 2020. The dashboard reflects the proportion of students 
logging in to Vula (UCT’s online learning management system) each week, categorised by level of 
engagement with online activities in course sites.

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES FOR 2021 Continued

 » Following  the  2020  analysis  of  examination  results  to  understand  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19 
pandemic and Emergency Remote Teaching on student performance, DASS repeated this analysis 
for 2021, comparing course results to the 2017–2019 and 2020 years, with a visualisation of high-
level shifts and more detailed reporting by Faculty and Course. A further exercise looked at the 
possible impact of the shift of modes of assessment from online back to on-campus written exams 
for some courses, although only limited data was available to support this analysis because of the 
variety of methods in which exams were timetabled and scheduled during 2021.

 » A number of ad hoc reports for the faculties were developed and provided. Examples included an 
analysis of the performance of third year MBChB students for the Faculty of Health Sciences and 
a course results analysis for the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment.

 » In support of a project to update the learning platform, DASS analysed participation rates and other 
metrics for student course evaluations from Vula data over a five-year period. This analysis formed 
part of the interim report on the Course Evaluations Sub-project presented to the Senate Teaching 
and Learning Committee in October 2021.

A  crucial  output  in  relation  to  understanding  student  course  performance  was  the  “Know  Your 
Students And Course” report which was developed according to specifications created by DASS, 
as informed by faculty focus groups. This report was launched with its distribution on 30 July 2021, 
emailed  as  a  PDF  to  course  convenors  for  whole-year  and  second  semester  courses  with  an 
enrolment of 20 or more students in undergraduate programmes and the Health Sciences MBChB, 
around 485 courses. This report is now part of the UCT analytics landscape and will be routinely 
provided to course convenors before the start of courses.
A second related project was UCT’s successful application for a Kresge Foundation Grant as part of 
the Siyaphumelela Project. UCT’s membership of Siyaphumelela brought the benefits of a local and 
international community of practice to support the embedding of data analytics into teaching and 
learning. DASS and DASSC were incorporated within the Siyaphumelela project.

Objective 2 – Support the development of academic teaching and learning skills

The Centre for Higher Education Development (CHED) is the unit responsible for the systematic 
development  of  UCT  academics  as  teachers.  The  New  Academic  Practitioner  Programme  has 
been  in  existence  for  over  two  decades  and  has  in  this  time  evolved  in  its  approach  to  engage 
academics’  understanding  and  practices  of  curriculum  and  pedagogy.  This  programme  functioned 
online during the lockdown ensuring the continuity of a fundamental aspect of staff development 
at UCT.
The pandemic increased the need of more specific training to support the online teaching effort. 
UCT’s Centre for Innovation in Learning and Teaching (CILT) is located within CHED and supports the 
professional development of teaching staff through a range of offerings including webinars, resources 
and guides and workshops aimed at teaching assistants and tutors.
During 2021 all workshops and webinars were run online. Over the course of the year, CILT offered 
74 webinars and workshops on a wide range of topics related to teaching and learning. Out of the 
3  459  UCT  staff  registrations  for  webinars  and  workshops,  2  584  staff  attended.  In  most  cases, 
recordings were available for registered participants. Examples of areas covered during 2021 include 
Assessment; Course design and facilitating online; Tool use to facilitate learning in our courses; and 
Preparing Tutors.
In addition to participation in the webinars, teaching staff could access over 100 resources and guides 
from the CILT resources page. Authored and maintained by CILT staff, these resources include guides 
on course design and content creation, teaching and learning strategies (i.e. student engagement), 
physically distanced learning and assessment.

Objective 3 – Develop a plan to offer digitally mediated education

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES FOR 2021 Continued

Also during 2021 CILT ran two short courses for professional development, namely Design Studio 
(a four-week online course created to assist teaching staff at UCT who are designing or redesigning 
their courses for blended and online contexts) and Facilitating Online (an eight-week course for online 
educators and trainers who lead online and blended courses, events, and communities). Design Studio 
ran four cohorts in 2021, with a total of 159 registrations. There were four Facilitating Online cohorts 
in 2021 with 117 registered participants, of whom 75 were active on the course. Participants who 
completed these courses were eligible for a UCT Short Course Certificate of Completion.
Staff  from  CILT’s  Academic  Staff  Development  (ASD)  and  Course  and  Curriculum  Design  (CCD) 
teams  are  linked  to  each  of  the  six  academic  faculties  and  offer  customised  support  on  aspects 
related to teaching, learning and assessment in blended and online contexts.
CILT also offers on-demand consultations. These book-able slots have provided a useful addition to 
the type of support available for teaching staff. Learning Designers are allocated to the faculties they 
work in and staff may book time to get advice on blended learning teaching strategies and course 
site design. A total of 145 sessions were booked in 2021.
In 2021, CILT offered a Rapid Refresh service which supported teaching staff with improving and 
preparing their courses for teaching in 2022. This included consultations and a diagnostic service to 
help teaching staff to identify specific areas for improvement or development. With the agreement of 
the course convenor, CILT deployed staff to work on specific areas of the course and then provided 
help and support for staff to carry forward the changes into their teaching. A total of 40 courses were 
worked on in 2021, over all six faculties, although the largest number of courses tackled was in the 
Faculty of Commerce (15 courses).

In  2021,  the  committee  responsible  for  online  education  matters,  the  Online  Education 
Sub-Committee (reporting to the Senate Teaching and Learning Committee) revised its terms 
of reference (ToR).
The revised ToR situates its purpose in foregrounding institutional strategy and the operationalisation 
thereof, strengthens relationships with other committees, and was intended to strengthen institutional 
policies in relation to online education. The amended Terms of Reference was approved by Senate 
in early 2021.
The first task of the revised Committee was to establish a task team that would be responsible for 
developing a Digitally Enabled Education (DEE) Strategy. It was intended that the Committee would 
focus on developing a longer-term strategy for UCT and how the University might take DEE forward 
post-pandemic  with  the  learnings  of  Physically  Distant  Learning  (PDL)  and  Emergency  Remote 
Teaching (ERT).
From July 2021, the workstream met to gather information for the development of a concept to 
enable the strategy development, about the context of digitally enabled education at UCT including:
 » Examples of online teaching at UCT, including good practices.
 » Resourcing of technology, confidence in the use thereof and staff development needs.
 » Enabling mechanisms in terms of course design, staff and student training, and infrastructure.
 » The dexterity of students in adapting to technologically based learning.
The  group  also  worked  to  generate  a  definition  of  the  concept  of  DEE;  perspectives  on  how 
prescriptive the strategy needed to be, including allowances for flexibility; learnings from ERT and PDL 
and determining whether access to DEE may lead to students to be less interactive. Another aspect 
included in a planned concept is the quality management of DEE.
The  group  planned  for  early  commencement  in  2022  to  finalise  principles  for  a  DEE  Strategy 
and Implementation Plan.

Objective 4 –  Implement the guidelines for curriculum review at undergraduate 

level

Following  the  drive  to  rethink  the  UCT  undergraduate  curriculum  in  the  light  of  decolonial 
theory perspective and the proposed and approval by Senate of a document Taking Curriculum 
Change Forward, the Teaching and Learning Committee of Senate started developing guidelines 
for curriculum review that could support programme convenors in this task. This work was halted 
by the efforts directed towards teaching under COVID-19 conditions; the demand on staff was simply 
too  high  to  expect  this  to  take  place.  Instead,  it  was  decided  to  support  faculties  with  resources 
as  part  of  a  pilot  exercise.  During  2021,  the  university  implemented  an  undergraduate  curriculum 
review project, funded by the University Capacity Development Grant. The project commenced in 
the Faculty of Commerce. The faculty was provided with various institutional level documents to use 
to develop a framework for the review. The framework developed in the faculty takes into account 
the Framework for Curriculum Change, Curriculum Change principles, transformation documents, as 
well  as  draft  Bachelor  of  Commerce  Standard  (CHE)  and  past  HEQSF  alignment  documents.  The 
framework will be used to draft desired graduate attributes and reflect on programme credits per 
year including proposals for changes. Revised courses are planned for approval by Senate from late 
2022 to early 2023.

To conduct research solving Afrika’s problems

Objective 1 – Develop the next generation of researchers and scholars

The ability to maintain UCT’s excellence in research is fundamentally dependent on its people. 
As such, UCT recognises the need for continued investment in the development and nurturing of its 
researchers, and in providing an enabling and supportive environment that allows them to grow and 
flourish. Through deliberate and targeted efforts, the University offers various capacity development 
interventions and other means of support across the academic pipeline. This contributes to growing a 
critical mass of highly skilled researchers and the next generation of internationally leading researchers 
with a focus on fostering a diversified and transformed pool of scholars. Additional investment through 
strategic funds directed by the VC and DVC responsible for research has been critical in augmenting 
external funding to sustain and advance efforts towards attainment of this goal.
To sustain research excellence at UCT, we need to invest in human capacity development initiatives, 
recognising that the research career path – while a rewarding one – is also very challenging. There are 
several initiatives across the institution to help academics at all stages of the academic life cycle reach 
key research milestones: PhDs, publications, successful postgraduate supervisions and grant awards, 
among others.
Postdoctoral research fellows (PDRFs) are, in many cases, aspirant academics funded via a diverse 
number  of  research  funding  vehicles  (including  the  university’s  General  Operating  Budget  (GOB), 
departmental awards, donations, investment income and the NRF) such that their primary engagement 
and focus is on full-time research. Worldwide the PDRF cohort is acknowledged as a key component 
of the research ecosystem that contributes strongly to research outputs. Development and funding 
support  for  UCT  PDRFs  serves  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  University’s  future  early-career  and 
established academics, while also providing training in teaching and supervision. In 2021, UCT hosted 
371 PDRFs (compared to 338 in 2020). Of these, 202 were South African or permanent residents 
and 169 were international. Among the 202 South African PDRFs, just under half (98 or 48.5%) were 
black (SA African, SA Coloured and SA Indian). The gender breakdown across the cohort was 194 
male and 177 female.

REPORT ON 2021 EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES 
Continued

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES FOR 2021 Continued
It has been recognised that at UCT there can be a gap between PDRFs and GOB-funded academic 
positions:  those  exiting  the  postdoctoral  fellow  role  are  often  not  yet  sufficiently  established  to 
compete for GOB-funded academic positions. Launched in 2019, the category of Junior Research 
Fellows is well-positioned in order to bridge this gap, providing an entry-level category to academic 
appointment  on  the  research  track,  equivalent  to  the  junior  lecturer  rank  on  the  teaching  track. 
The  Junior  Research  Fellow  awards  aim  to  strengthen  the  career-pathing  of  a  next  generation 
of  researchers  that  are  nurtured  and  well-networked  into  a  community  of  scholars  working  in  an 
interdisciplinary  way  and,  secondly,  to  bolstering  the  interdisciplinary  research  capacity  of  UCT’s 
research groupings. In 2019, 10 awards (cohort 1) were made while six awards (cohort 2) in 2020 with 
the fellows to commence in 2021.
The  Emerging  Researcher  Programme  (ERP),  first  launched  in  2003,  has  become  a 
UCT  flagship  capacity-building  programme  that  targets  early  career  academics  to  grow 
their  research  capacity,  enhance  their  productivity  and  provide  an  enabling  environment 
that  contributes  to  transformation  at  UCT  through  the  retention  and  research  capacity 
development of young staff. The ERP is for early career academics or those who have not yet 
established  themselves  as  researchers.  It  is  funded  through  the  Vice  Chancellor’s  Strategic  Fund 
as well as the DHET’s University Capacity Development Grant (UCDG). The programme dovetails 
with  other  initiatives  such  as  the  New  Academic  Practitioners  Programme  (located  in  CHED),  
the programme for postgraduate students arranged by the Directorate of Postgraduate Studies and 
Researcher Development) and the Next Generation Professoriate administered from the Office of 
the Vice Chancellor.
A total of 1 078 academic staff have participated in the ERP since its inception, with 64 new members 
joining in 2021. Of the 64 new members in 2021, 26 were male and 38 were female. Importantly, 
representation of black South Africans on the ERP is 62.4% (in comparison with 34.3% on the UCT

staff) while female members comprise 61.8% (in comparison with 50.7% of all academics at UCT). It is 
also noteworthy that of the 100 academics who were promoted in 2021, 56 had been ERP members 
at some stage of their careers.
UCT has also responded energetically to the New Generation of Academics Programme (nGAP), an 
opportunity provided by the Department of Higher Education (DHET) to build a new generation of 
black South African academics. The DHET’s 2015 vision document proposes a suite of initiatives to 
address the challenge, with nGAP being the major instrument to increase the numbers of black South 
African academics. UCT’s nGAP scholars operate as a single cohort, managed and coordinated from 
within the Office of the Vice Chancellor. Progress in relation to the nGAP at UCT is outlined in this 
report on page 35.

Objective 2 – Expand access and funding for senior postgraduate students

The  2015–2016  Fees  Must  Fall  student  movement  highlighted  the  challenges  experienced 
within  the  student  funding  landscape  across  South  Africa.  In  the  postgraduate  sector,  it  was 
particularly noted that postgraduate students are not supported by NSFAS. To address access to 
postgraduate  studies  for  students  from  low-income  families,  UCT’s  postgraduate  funding  policy 
changed in 2018 to facilitate support of students funded by NSFAS (or eligible for NSFAS funding) at 
undergraduate level, but up to this point not explicitly funded by the General Operating Budget (GOB). 
The analysis of the quantum and structure of postgraduate funding led to the introduction of the full 
cost  of  attendance  (FCOA)  model  of  funding  for  students  with  potential  for  postgraduate  study 
who require financial aid. In 2018, honours students were funded, with master’s and doctoral funding 
introduced in 2019 and scaled to address the additional years of the degree in 2020 (and 2021).
The general principle guiding the new model was that students who qualified for full financial aid at 
undergraduate  level  should  have  an  expectation  of  a  significant  level  of  support  at  postgraduate 
level if there is a reasonable chance of them completing the proposed degree. UCT thus changed its 
policy for GOB-based funding to offer support at levels up to an assessed FCOA. This is intended to 
allow students without financial resources to continue, while also supporting the maximum number of 
students within a limited budget. In addition, a number of prestigious awards based on excellence, but 
of small value, are also made. Together, these are efforts to retain excellent postgraduate students 
who are likely to make a significant contribution to the university’s research output and to contribute 
toward transformation and social justice.
This FCOA approach is aligned with the changes in NRF funding policy which followed, announced 
in 2019 and introduced for the 2021 funding year. It also recognised that with the higher value of the 
FCOA funding and fixed overall funding pool, fewer students are expected to be successful in their 
NRF applications. This places additional strain on the provision of adequate postgraduate funding.

The sudden national lockdown in March 2020 due to COVID-19 added to funding challenges across 
the  board.  Challenges  included  the  need  for  travel  funds  and  alternative  accommodation  during 
lockdown,  the  extension  of  lab-based  honours  programmes  requiring  extension  of  stipends  by 
two months, the extension of master’s and doctoral stipends where research was delayed by the 
pandemic (largely not met by the PGFO funds) and the increase in humanitarian need.

At the master’s level, the proportion of black South African students increased from 33.9% in 2017 
to 40.3% in 2021. At the doctoral level, the proportion of black South African enrolments increased 
from 28.1% in 2017 to 35.6% in 2021. At the same time, the fractions of SA white and International 
master’s enrolments decreased, from 25.7% in 2017 to 20.8% in 2021 and from 26% in 2017 to 22% 
in 2021 respectively. At the doctoral level, the SA white proportion dropped from 27.5% in 2017 to 
21% in 2021, while the international fraction dropped by just one percentage point to 34.7% of the 
total in 2021.
The international fraction among the university’s postdoctoral fellows dominated across the 2017–
2021 period, making up 45.6% of all PDRFs in 2021. At the same time, the black South African fraction 
of this cohort increased from 20.7% in 2017 to 26.4% in 2021, while the white fraction dropped by 
seven percentage points to 22.9% in 2021. While substantial proportions of particularly master’s and 
doctoral students have opted not to declare their race in recent years (17% of all master’s enrolments 
and  8.8%  of  all  doctoral  enrolments  in  2021),  making  it  difficult  to  gauge  transformation  of  these 

cohorts over the period shown here, it would seem that improved diversity and inclusivity needs to 
be accelerated via a particular institutional focus.
Accordingly,  UCT  officially  launched  its  Accelerated  Transformation  of  the  Academic  Programme 
(ATAP) initiative in mid-October 2021 (see Goal 1, Objective 1 page 15).
This  programme  is  about  enhancing  opportunity  for  young  and  outstanding  scholars  through  the 
provision of bursaries and scholarships coupled with nurturing and ultimately producing a critical mass 
of black South African academics. As an academic programme, the ATAP is designed to enable a 
rigorous, yet short route from postgraduate study into being academic career-ready.
In  addition  to  furthering  the  careers  of  black  South  African  academics,  the  programme  plays  an 
important role in ensuring that UCT is able to achieve the goals set by the university’s Vision 2030. 
The  programme  represents  a  significant  milestone  towards  the  practical  wraparound  support 
and  mentoring  of  black  South  African  masters,  PhD  and  post-doctorate  fellows,  as  embedded  in 
UCT’s Vision 2030, which is anchored in three pillars: excellence, transformation and sustainability.

It is apparent that across the university as a whole, times to degree among master’s and doctoral 
graduates  have  increased  in  recent  years.  Specifically  comparing  the  graduation  years  2017  and 
2021, it appears that the overall institutional time to degree among master’s graduates increased from 
2.6 years to 3.2 years, while the overall time to degree among doctoral graduates increased from five 
years in 2017 to six years in 2021.
UCT  is  of  the  view  that  the  reasons  contributing  to  the  increases  in  time  to  degree  are  diverse, 
including funding challenges for students as well as an increase in the numbers of de facto part-time 
students (which are not captured on the Peoplesoft student system, or reflected in HEMIS). Other 
possible contributing factors include the impact of administrative efficiencies and the timelines for 
thesis examination, over-scoped or over-ambitious research projects, limited supervision as well as 
limited  technical  and  other  forms  of  support.  Under  such  circumstances  students  may  experience 
a lack of drive and focus as result of unclear or unmet expectations. In addition, it is apparent that 
students are often poorly prepared for independent study, have poor project management skills and 
that perhaps inappropriate recruitment decisions are also a factor.

Initial  interventions  in  the  research-based  postgraduate  degrees  to  address  this  risk  include  the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for entering students/Progress and Planned Activity (PPA) 
process for returning students, which are designed to enhance planning and monitoring and to align 
expectations  between  student  and  supervisor  in  relation  to  scope  and  roles.  The  Memorandum 
of  Understanding  (MoU)  details  the  expectation  of  students  and  supervisors  in  their  supervision 
relationship, included at registration, or once a topic and supervisor have been assigned. Progress 
against agreed milestones is updated and reviewed annually via a similarly formatted Progress and 
Planned Activity (PPA) form.
There is also an initiative to address the timeline of examination of postgraduate outputs and expand 
and incentivise uptake of resources and skills development to support postgraduate studies. Other 
potential  interventions  include  the  introduction  of  a  formal  panel-based  review  of  progress  in  the 
postgraduate  research  project  at  key  points  in  the  degree,  exploration  and  evaluation  of  new 
approaches to supervision, and the potential for a more structured approach in the early stages of 
postgraduate studies.

REPORT ON 2021 EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES 
Continued

PERFORMANCE AGAINST THE 
EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES FOR 2021 Continued

The  present  focus  is  on  the  research  support  strategy.  The  support  needs  of  researchers  within 
the  university  vary  based  on  stage  in  research  career,  nature  of  research,  source  of  funding  and 
whether researchers work individually or in teams. A one-size-fits-all approach to research support 
is therefore not appropriate. In keeping with these aspects, researchers within all the faculties have 
been clustered into groupings based on nature of research activity. Workshops to identify support 
needs, as well as awareness and appropriateness of existing support capabilities, will soon be held 
with researchers from each grouping in each faculty.
This strategy process is critical to understand the research support processes across UCT and their 
intercalation  across  research  funds  centre,  department,  faculty  and  central  UCT  structures.  It  will 
inform the design of workstreams through the remainder of the project.

Objective 5 – Improve research management and support systems

Objective 6 – Support research focused on the SDGs

UCT has launched an ambitious project to significantly improve the structures and processes 
that support and facilitate research. This Research Support Transformation Project aims to position 
UCT’s research to flourish and grow, facilitated through effective and efficient research support. The 
project  will  review  and  adapt  the  university’s  research  support  systems  to  better  facilitate  UCT’s 
research.
While research at UCT has grown exponentially over the last decade, it is clear that research support 
capacity  within  the  university  has  not  grown  at  the  same  rate.  Presently  UCT  research  support 
capabilities  (people,  processes,  systems,  finances,  equipment)  are  thus  not  sufficiently  aligned  to 
the changed research landscape. Many support processes have been retrofitted from teaching and 
learning and, as a result, are not necessarily fit for purpose for the research endeavour, putting the 
university at risk.
At the same time, the growth of inter- and transdisciplinary research together with global and continental 
partnerships, and more interfaculty interaction, requires new ways of working to be effective, including 
new  policies,  procedures,  processes,  and  authority  levels.  These  require  collaborative  design  with 
researchers, research partners and possibly even funders.
The scoping of Phase I of this project was initiated during 2021 and highlighted addressing key “pain 
points” in the research landscape for which rapid solutions could be found. Phase II addresses research 
support from a systems perspective. Running from January to December 2022, it is comprised of 
12 workstreams.
The  Project  includes  six  high  priority  workstreams,  namely  project  management,  process 
optimisation,  strategy,  training,  organisational  design,  and  change  management.  Other 
workstreams  include:  benchmarking,  the  research  finance  model,  systems,  trans-disciplinary/inter-
disciplinary research, research administration process redesign, governance and postgraduate support.

During 2020, UCT participated for the first time in the Times Higher Education (THE) Impact Rankings, 
which  –  unlike  other  such  international  rankings  –  aims  to  assess  the  impact  of  higher  education 
institutions against the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). UCT participated in 
the following SDGs in 2020 and again in 2021:

SDG 1 

SDG 5 

No poverty

Gender equality

SDG 10 
Reduced 
inequalities

SDG 3 

Good health 
and well-being

SDG 16 

Peace, justice 

and strong 
institutions

SDG 17 

Partnerships 
for the goals

In order to assess a university’s success in delivering the SDGs, THE looks at indicators across four 
broad areas: research, stewardship, outreach and teaching. Universities that provide data on SDG 17 
and at least three other SDGs are included in the overall ranking exercise.
In the rankings for individual SDGs (which were released early in 2021), UCT was placed in the top 
100 institutions for three critical areas: reduction of poverty, gender equality and reduced inequalities. 
UCT was placed in the 101–200 band in the overall global ranking.
UCT’s values, which include enhancing the lives of individuals and communities and advancing the 
public good, emphasise the need for the university’s work to contribute to bettering society beyond 
the institution. The THE Impact Rankings offer a way to gauge this on the international stage via the 
widely  adopted  SDGs  –  an  integrated  framework  for  ensuring  that  global  development  balances 
social, economic and environmental sustainability.

Section2 PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGETS IN THE 

2021 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN

The data and numbers reported in this section are all based on an early HEMIS submission 3 
extract. It is likely that there will be minor changes to HEMIS Sub 3 between the submission of 
this report to Council, and the final version of HEMIS Sub 3.

STUDENT NUMBERS1
The actual headcount enrolment in 2021 was 29 608 students, including 223 occasional students, 
17  897  undergraduate  full  degree  students,  3  201  postgraduates  below  the  master’s  level,  6  052 
master’s students and 2 235 doctoral enrolments. The actual 2021 headcount enrolment exceeded 
the 2021 headcount enrolment target of 28 174 by 1 434 students (or 5.1% of the target).
The  variances  within  the  various  qualification  types  against  2021  targets  are  quite  marked  in 
some  cases,  but  are  understandable  given  the  acceleration  of  senior  postgraduate  enrolment 
growth  beyond  expected  levels,  the  impact  of  the  decision  to  suspend  academic  exclusions 
at  the  end  of  2020  (which  gave  rise  to  an  expansion  of  the  undergraduate  enrolment 
in  2021),  and  the  contraction  of  semester  study  abroad  enrolments  in  the  wake  of  the 
#RhodesMustFall/#FeesMustFall  protests,  the  severe  drought  and  the  subsequent  COVID-19 
epidemic.  Also  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  epidemic  and  its  impact  on  research  students’  ability 
to  undertake  their  field  and  laboratory  work,  concessions  were  granted  to  honours  and  master’s 
students  towards  the  end  of  2020  which  had  the  effect  of  extending  their  period  of  enrolment  
into  2021.  While  there  were  positive  variances  in  student  enrolments  at  the  undergraduate  level 
(17 897 compared to a target of 16 456), at the postgraduate below master’s level (3 201 compared 
to a target of 3 008), at the master’s level (6 052 actual against a 5 150 target) and at the doctoral 
level (2 235 against a target of 2 073), the 2021 occasional enrolment, which includes the Semester 
Study Abroad enrolment, was just 223 against a target of 1 488.
While  the  current  enrolment  planning  submission  reflects  a  target  of  zero  in  respect  of  distance 
students,  the  2021  HEMIS  submission  shows  a  total  of  36  non-contact  students;  these  students 
were mostly enrolled in the Postgraduate Diploma in Health Economics, which was approved and 
accredited  subsequent  to  the  DHET  enrolment  planning  exercise  that  yielded  the  current  agreed 
targets.
The 2021 first-time entering, full degree undergraduate enrolment (4 249) was 4.3% greater than 
the target of 4 074. The overshoot in the first-time entering undergraduate intake arose largely due 
to  the  absence  of  the  National  Benchmark  Tests  (NBTs)  during  2020  and  better  than  expected 
performance  in  the  National  Senior  Certificate  (NSC)  examination,  together  yielding  a  larger  than 
anticipated number of eligible applicants at the end of the 2021 admissions cycle.

1  The targets derive from the approved enrolment and efficiency targets for 2020 to 2025 as set out in the Minister’s letter 

of 29 January 2020.

In  terms  of  disciplinary  fields,  the  2021  enrolment  was  projected  to  be  made  up  of  43%  in 
Science,  Engineering  and  Technology  (SET),  24%  in  Business/Management,  1%  in  Education 
and  32%  in  the  broad  Humanities.  The  actual  proportions  for  2021  were  as  follows:  46%  in  SET, 
22%  in  Business/Management,  3%  in  Education  and  29%  in  the  broad  Humanities.  The  increase  
in  the  Education  fraction  to  some  extent  reflects  a  very  much  larger  than  anticipated  enrolment  
in the PGCE (Senior Phase and FET Teaching).

DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS
The  targeted  racial  profile  of  the  2021  South  African  enrolment  was  38%  African,  18%  coloured,  
9% Indian and 35% white. The actual demographic profile of the 2021 South African enrolment was 
as follows: 34% African, 15% coloured, 6% Indian, 19% white and 26% undisclosed. The continuing 
pattern of a high proportion of students with undisclosed race makes it difficult to assess performance 
in  relation  to  our  demographic  targets.  The  demographic  profile  of  the  overall  2021  enrolment  is 
shown below:

A disproportionate but desirable increase in SA African enrolments (23.5% against an overall increase 
of  3.1%)  is  apparent.  Over  the  2017  to  2021  period,  SA  White  enrolments  decreased  by  31.7%, 
SA  Indian  enrolments  decreased  by  16.1%  and  international  enrolments  decreased  by  25.7%;  the 
marked decline in international enrolments since 2017 was largely due to the substantial decrease in 
enrolments in the Semester Study Abroad (SSA) programme mentioned above.
There has been a considerable increase in students with undisclosed race in the past five years (from 
3 814 in 2017 to 6 931 in 2021). Comparative analysis of the relevant demographic data indicates that 
the unwillingness to declare race is an issue across all population groups. This is particularly evident at 
the undergraduate level, where “redress category” data from the applicant file is reasonably complete 
and can be used for comparative purposes. At this stage, there is, however, no effective strategy in 
place that encourages students to disclose their race upon registration.

The actual 2021 headcount enrolment exceeded the 2021 headcount 
enrolment target of 28 174 by 1 434 students (or 5.1% of the target).

STUDENT HOUSING
The 2021 UCT bed capacity per tier of residence, and in relation to new and returning students, was 
6 537. It is worth noting that this capacity was reduced due to single room occupancy practice, as a 
result of COVID-19 transmission preventative measures. 646 beds were forfeited as a result.
The table below shows that 6 482 students were accommodated in the on-campus residence system 
as of 30 June 2021, and that the occupancy rate was thus 99.2%, very slightly short of the 100% 
occupancy target. It should be noted that only 1 762 new First Tier students reflect as bookings, 
against a capacity of 2 250, largely due to the low take-up rate on the 4 500 housing offers made 
at this level. 120 of these new First Tier students were allocated to Second Tier residences. Student 
Housing  and  Residence  Life  allocated  residence  places  to  a  number  of  first  years  on  the  housing 
waiting list and also re-allocated a number of first-time entering students who were initially placed in 
leased off-campus accommodation. Included in the table below are the totals for the students were 
allocated to university leased off-campus accommodation.

Section2 PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGETS IN THE 

2021 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE PLAN Continued

STUDENT SUCCESS RATES
Please  note  that  specific  objectives  linked  to  the  University  Capacity  Development  Grant  are 
discussed on pages 31–33 below.
UCT  expected  in  the  region  of  6  766  graduates  in  2021.  This  target  included  a  projected  3  402 
undergraduate completions, 2 015 completions below the master’s level, 1 099 master’s graduates 
and 250 doctoral graduates. To date, we have recorded 7 081 graduates in respect of 2021, made up 
of 3 356 undergraduate completions, 2 114 postgraduate completions below the master’s level, 1 337 
master’s graduates and 274 doctoral completions.
Among  the  graduates  to  date,  41%  were  in  SET,  23%  were  in  business/management,  5%  were  in 
education and 30% were in the broad humanities. The 2021 graduate total included 668 research 
master’s graduates in all disciplines (against a target of 613).
The expected 2021 graduate outputs in the scarce skills areas included 543 Engineering graduates, 
249 Life and Physical Sciences graduates, 349 Human Health graduates and 120 Teacher Education 
graduates. Actual graduates in the scarce skills areas included 407 Engineering graduates, 211 graduates 
in the Life and Physical Sciences, 352 Human Health graduates and 202 Teacher Education graduates. 
Graduate targets were thus largely achieved, apart from in the Engineering area.
The undergraduate (HEMIS levels 41, 42 and 43) course success rate in 2021 was 80% (against a 
target of 85%), while the overall course success rate was 75.6% against a target of 82%. The 2021 
undergraduate course success rates among South African and international students are shown below:

The undergraduate course success rates in 2021 thus ranged between 71.3% (for SA African students) 
at the lower level and 90.1% for SA white students, at the upper end. The success rates at all levels 
were markedly lower than in 2020 and it can be assumed that this was largely due to the mainly 
remote teaching situation during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Course success rates in the scarce skills areas were as follows: 80% in Engineering (against a target 
of 84%), 77% in the Life and Physical Sciences (against a target of 84%), 99% in Animal and Human 
Health (against a target of 96%) and 93% in Teacher Education (against a target of 97%).
Examination  of  the  longitudinal  performance  of  the  2017  first-time  entering  undergraduate  (FU) 
cohorts, excluding Health Sciences entrants, shows the following:

 » 70% of the 2017 FU cohort (the same as within the equivalent 2016 FU cohort) had completed an 

undergraduate qualification within five years of registering at UCT.

 » 9% of the 2017 cohort (the same as within the 2016 cohort) had been excluded from UCT on 

academic grounds during the five-year period of the analysis.

 » The rate of dropout in good academic standing among the 2017 FU cohort had dropped to 10%, 

in comparison with 12% among the 2016 cohort.

 » 11%  of  the  2017  FU  cohort  were  still  busy  with  undergraduate  studies  at  the  end  of  2021. 

This proportion had stabilised at between 6% and 9% within recent FU cohorts.

 » It must be noted that part of UCT’s response to the COVID-19 situation and the resultant difficulties 
experienced by students during Emergency Remote Teaching was to suspend academic exclusions 
at the end of 2020; this gave rise to a much larger undergraduate retention pattern than usual in the 
2020 to 2021 transition and has (as mentioned above) caused a spike in the 2021 undergraduate 
enrolment.

RESEARCH OUTPUTS
The table below includes the 2021 publication count, and the weighted research outputs generated 
by  research  master’s  and  doctoral  graduates.  The  publication  unit  figure  reflects  the  submitted 
claimed publication count for submission to the DHET:

Note:  Publication  Units  are  provisional,  reflecting  units  submitted  to  the  DHET.  Research  master’s  and  doctoral 
graduates are also provisional, extracted from an early HEMIS Submission 3.
The 2021 ratio of weighted research outputs per permanent instruction/research staff member was 
thus approximately 2:82, against a target of 2:44.

ACADEMIC STAFFING
UCT’s 2021 HEMIS staffing submission shows that a total of 1 182 (against a target of 1 208) permanent 
instruction/research or academic staff were employed in the six faculties and in CHED. This is slightly 
higher  than  the  2020  total  of  1  176.  The  2021  academic  staffing  headcount  translated  into  1  618 
instruction/research staff FTEs (against a target of 1 830).
The proportion of permanent, full-time academic staff qualified at the doctoral level in 2021 was 62% 
(61% in 2020). A further 29% of these academic staff held master’s degrees. The Research sections 
of this report suggest that students across the University could expect to be taught by academic 
staff actively engaged in research in their particular disciplines.

University of Cape Town Annual Report 2021 30

www.uct.ac.zacreated huge problems for most of the projects as they were unable to employ staff, including tutors 
and  teaching  assistants,  to  work  on  the  projects.  The  situation  became  untenable  and  the  UCDP 
project team was forced to ask the Central Finance Office of the university to advance the funding 
to the projects to enable the project leaders to make some progress on implementation. At the end 
of September 2021, the DHET informed the sector that all expenditure would be extended to 31 
March 2022 owing to the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the extreme delay in the 
transfer of funds to the universities. Despite this extension, some projects were in a difficult situation 
and could not spend their entire allocation within six months.
UCT’s final tranche of the 2021 funds was R7 910 000 after the final amounts were confirmed in 
a letter to the Vice-Chancellor on 4 February 2022. This was made up of the underspend of the 
previous year of R1 423 417 and R6 486 583 that was received on 9 February 2022. The delay in the 
funding not only created many problems for project leaders but also put pressure for the UCDP team 
and hampered their ability to implement and monitor the projects under the very trying conditions 
created by the pandemic.
UCT’s UCDP Plan for 2021–2023 has 14 projects in the student, staff and programme development 
and  management  areas  of  the  UCDG.  All  projects  are  aligned  to  the  principles  underpinning  the 
UCDP and to the objectives of UCT’s strategic plan, Vision 2030. These projects are located in the 
faculties with a few cross-faculty collaborations.

REPORT ON UCT OPERATIONS DURING 2021 Continued

Section3 REPORT ON EARMARKED GRANTS

Earmarked  grants  are  part  of  the  funding  framework  provided  by  the  Department  of  Higher 
Education and Training (DHET) to all public higher education institutions. These funds are used for 
specific purposes designated by the Minister. The accountability for the use of these grants is through 
the  submission  of  detailed  narrative  progress  reports  and  audited  financial  statements  which  are 
provided on an annual basis by the universities. The University enters into an agreement with the 
Department of Higher Education and Training about programmes and activities that will be funded, 
and the approved budget. UCT has not had any adverse findings and therefore has not had any funds 
withheld by the Department due to concerns around spending or lack of meaningful progress.

REPORT ON THE INSTITUTION’S UTILISATION OF THE 
UNIVERSITY CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT GRANT (UCDG)
The UCDP is a national strategic programme implemented by the Department of Higher Education 
and  Training  (DHET)  and  universities  that  seeks  to  contribute  to:  equitable  access  and  high  levels 
of  success  for  all  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  students;  the  creation  of  an  academic  pipeline 
to  facilitate  the  transformation  of  the  academic  workforce  through  quality  research  development 
and teaching opportunities along the entire academic career trajectory; provision of development 
opportunities for professional staff and the development and/or renewal of academic programmes 
and curricula. The UCDP is meant to be transformative and operates at the nexus of quality, equity 
and success in universities, which should be addressed simultaneously as non-competing imperatives.

UCDP Institutional Grant
For the previous three-year UCDP funding cycle (2018–2020), UCT submitted the close-out audited 
narrative and financial reports to the DHET on 31 May 2021. This was due to the DHET’s extension of 
the 2020 budget spending to 31 March 2021 to accommodate the unforeseen delays in implementing 
projects throughout the sector caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The total allocation for 
the institutional UCDP in 2020 was R11 928 000, with a total expenditure, including commitments, of 
R10 504 583 and an amount of R1 423 417 unspent.
For the current funding cycle (2021–2023), the DHET approved the university’s UCDP Plan in January 
2021 with a budget allocation of R12 316 862 for the year (Ministerial Statement, December 2020). 
The allocation was amended to R11 227 352 (Addendum to Ministerial Statement, April 2021), which 
led to a sensitive process of budget reductions in some of the projects.
UCT received R3 317 352, which is 25% of the 2021 budget allocation, on 10 March 2021 for the 
new funding cycle. However, the transfer of the remaining 75% of the budget allocation was delayed 
despite assurances from the DHET that the university would receive the funds in September 2021. 
The funding of R6 486 583 was received on 9 February 2022. This delay in receiving the funding

In 2021, the responsibility for the project and financial management of the institutional UCDG for the 
new cycle and the collaborative grants was moved to the Centre for Higher Education Development 
(CHED),  specifically,  the  Programme  Manager  for  Teaching  and  Learning  and  the  Faculty  Finance 
Manager in the CHED Dean’s Office. Moving the entire UCDP to CHED placed a significant demand 
on these two staff members and it was fortuitous that in August 2021, the DHET invited UCT, as 
one of seven universities, to submit a proposal for additional capacity to improve the management 
and  implementation  capacity  of  the  UCDP  with  a  budget  of  R1  125  000  for  the  period  1  April 

to  31  December  2021  (extended  to  31  March  2022)  and  R  1 500 000  each  for  2022  and  2023. 
The  approved  proposal  includes  funding  for  the  salaries  of  the  UCDP  Institutional  Manager  and 
the  Administrator.  It  also  provides  funding  for  financial,  administrative  support  and  specialist  M&E 
support to assist with CREST’s and the DHET’s reporting requirements. The DHET approved UCT’s 
proposal on 1 February 2022 in a letter to the Vice-Chancellor and indicated that this funding would 
be released separately from the Main grant in each academic year. UCT received R1 125 000 on 9 
February 2022.

In  2021,  CREST  and  the  DHET  developed  a  Management  Information  System  (MIS)  for  the 
UCDP.  UCT’s  UCDP  team  attended  regular  training  sessions  with  CREST  and  participated  in 
the  training  sessions  for  project  leaders.  The  UCT  Institutional  Manager  has  provided  ongoing 
support to project leaders to assist them with uploading their progress reports on the MIS. Many 
project  leaders  have  responded  favourably  on  the  MIS  as  it  has  simplified  their  reporting.  The 
workload  of  the  UCDP  has  become  more  streamlined  and  has  allowed  for  improved  monitoring 
of  project  implementation.  All  2021  narrative  and  audited  financial  reports  will  be  uploaded  via  a 
range of annexures on the MIS before 31 May 2022. The DHET is no longer accepting reports in  
electronic format.

UCDP Collaborative Projects
The  UCDP  provides  the  opportunity  for  collaborative  development  activities  to  be  undertaken. 
The university-led collaborative projects must be of national strategic importance, have sector-wide 
participation and benefit and be aligned to one or more of the focus areas identified for support 
through  the  UCDP.  It  has  one  university  that  acts  as  a  fund-holder  and  coordinator  but  involves 
multiple universities on an equal partnership basis. In 2021, UCT was the lead institution in four projects 
funded by the Collaborative Grants. The DHET extended the expenditure for the collaborative grants 
to 31 March 2022.

CLINICAL TRAINING GRANT
The Clinical Training Grant (CTG) has changed the landscape of clinical teaching at the University of 
Cape Town since 2008 when it was first introduced. Over the past 14 years, UCT has utilised the 
grant to make strategic appointments of clinical teachers, appoint support staff to support clinical 
teaching and training, invest in key infrastructure projects and purchase equipment for clinical training 
that the public health sector is not able to afford. The CTG has allowed the faculty to continue the 
expansion  of  its  clinical  training  platform  to  Vredenburg  on  the  West  Coast  and  George,  Knysna, 
Mossel Bay and Oudtshoorn in the Garden Route District in the Southern Cape. The CTG has not 
only  impacted  on  clinical  teaching  and  training  but  also  the  care  that  is  offered  to  patients  in  the 
Western Cape.
The CTG has been a valuable resource in ensuring that UCT is able to provide a high standard of 
clinical  training  and  that  graduates  are  fit  for  purpose.  UCT’s  aim  is  to  continue  to  provide  quality 
clinical teaching and training support to the Health Sciences programmes to maintain high pass rates 
and good throughput rates of our health professional students.
In  2021/2022,  the  CTG  funding  was  unfortunately  reduced  by  10%  from  an  initial  budget  of 
R61.1  million  to  R54.8  million.  Nevertheless,  the  funding  was  vital  in  enabling  the  appointment  of  
>80 key clinical teachers (75% of the total funding); and >30 support staff (17% of total funding), 
which  included  facilitators  at  decentralised  learning  centres,  and  community-based  education  
sites,  fulfilling  our  faculty  mandate  of  a  primary  health  care  approach  to  teaching  and  learning.  
The remaining 7% of the funding was utilised for operational costs, clinical equipment and some minor 
infrastructure projects.

Section3 REPORT ON EARMARKED GRANTS Continued

CLINICAL TRAINING GRANT Continued
A  total  of  75%  of  the  CTG  funding  supported  the  MBChB  programme,  specifically  students  in 
years three, four, five and six, across 11 disciplines, as well as the MMed programme. The other 25% of 
the funding supported senior clinical (third and fourth year) students in the Health and Rehabilitation 
Sciences  programmes  (Physiotherapy,  Occupational  Therapy,  Speech  Language  Pathology  and 
Audiology).
The  Grant  for  the  Nelson  Mandela  Fidel  Castro  (NMFC)  Programme  students  has  been  steadily 
decreasing over the past five years by 75% from approximately R1 million per annum, to now only 
R235k  per  annum  to  support  the  same  number  of  students.  A  dedicated  convenor  for  the  two 
NMFC student cohorts, as well as additional academic and clinical skills support is provided for these 
students, who have shown improved throughput over the past two years. The decreased funding is, 
however, not sustainable for this additional support.

NATIONAL STUDENT FINANCIAL AID SCHEME
The biggest provider of student financial aid at undergraduate level is the National Student Financial 
Aid  Scheme  (NSFAS)  which  is  a  government  entity  under  the  Department  of  Higher  Education, 
Science,  and  Innovation.  NSFAS  provides  funding  to  eligible  students  enrolled  in  public  higher 
education institutions, and Technical, Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Colleges.
The university remains appreciative of the NSFAS funding granted to students that has facilitated 
access to many thousands of students whose families do not have the financial means to help them 
realise  their  academic  ambitions.  NSFAS  students  receive  full  cost  funding,  thereby  reducing  the 
burden on their families and enabling students to focus on their studies without any financial challenges. 
The eligibility for NSFAS funding is students whose household income is below R350 000.
In 2021, UCT received R761.3 million (R639.1 million in 2020) supporting a total of a total of 6 506 
students,  with  a  further  310  students  receiving  UCT  (NSFAS)  GAP  funding.  UCT  GAP  funding  is 
considered for those applicants that did not meet the NSFAS eligibility criteria but still need some 
financial assistance towards their study costs (the so called “missing middle ”). The financial assistance 
provided to GAP funded students is a course fee bursary and a UCT Loan offer. Students with a 
gross family income of between R350 00 and R600 000 are eligible for GAP funding.
The demand for NSFAS assistance has grown exponentially. As a result, the 2021 funding confirmation 
for students was delayed due to additional funding NSFAS required. It is also unfortunate that students 
studying for the Postgraduate Certificate in Education, the Postgraduate Diploma in Accounting and 

the graduate LLB programme were informed after the 2021 registration that these programmes were 
no longer eligible for NSFAS funding. The university provided financial support to these students to 
mitigate any adverse impact on their academic studies. NSFAS funding policy stability has become 
imperative and it is clear that late funding policy changes have a negative impact on affected students 
who are unable to find alternative options at a late stage. Outside the support provided by NSFAS, 
corporates, non-governmental organisations, donations, foundations, and funding from the university 
augment the funding received from NSFAS. A total of R1.219 billion was received for undergraduate 
student financial support.

FOUNDATION PROVISION GRANT
The  Foundation  Provision  Grant  complements  the  teaching  input  sub-block  grant  through  which 
undergraduates are funded. The main purpose of this grant is to improve the academic performance 
of  first-time  entering  undergraduate  students.  The  main  targets  are  students  who  already  comply 
with the minimum requirements to enrol for a university qualification, and who have already enrolled 
for that qualification, but are at risk of failing or dropping out. Such students are placed on extended 
curriculum programmes approved by the minister. These programmes are in most cases one year 
longer than the regular qualification. In 2021, UCT offered six extended curriculum programmes in 
the faculties of Humanities, Science, Commerce and Engineering and the Built Environment. As is 
the case every year, UCT made a substantial additional financial contribution to ensure responsible 
delivery  of  its  extended  curriculum  programmes.  This  signals  the  importance  that  the  institution 
attaches to supporting students encountering academic challenges.
The DHET allocation to UCT was R16.066 million in 2021, with UCT complementing this allocation 
substantially.  As  in  2020,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  impacted  negatively  on  numbers  of  first-time 
entering students enrolled on extended curriculum programmes at UCT, although there was a slight 
improvement in numbers from 2020 to 2021. A total of 612 first-time entering students were enrolled 
in extended curriculum programmes in 2021, compared with the enrolment figure of 523 reported 
in 2020. As in 2020, the two programmes in Health Sciences were still on hold in 2021 because of 
the impact of COVID-19 conditions. Despite these setbacks, UCT continues to act as a dedicated 
provider  of  foundation  provision  in  extended  curriculum  programmes,  offering  students  carefully 
structured opportunities to study successfully at a higher education level.

The university remains appreciative of the NSFAS funding granted to 
students that has facilitated access to many thousands of students 
whose families do not have the financial means to help them realise their 
academic ambitions.

NEW GENERATION OF ACADEMICS PROGRAMME
New Generation of Academics Programme (nGAP) was created in terms of Staffing South Africa’s 
Universities Framework (SSAUF), which was approved by the Minister of Higher Education, Dr Blade 
Nzimande, in January 2015. The programme provides a systemic response to the challenges faced 
by the higher education sector. These include inequality of representation amongst existing staff, an 
ageing academic staff cohort, unequal and/or unfavourable staff/student ratios, low throughput rates, 
a growing but inadequate postgraduate pipeline, as well as existing staff in possession of inadequate 
qualifications and expertise to be effective in a system with growing complex demands. The most 
notable features of the programme are that successful applicants (mainly black South African and 
female) are appointed into permanent posts firmly located within long-term staffing plans right from 
the outset, and that appointments are governed by contracts that clearly spell out the expectations, 
obligations,  roles,  and  responsibilities  of  the  employing  university  and  of  the  newly  appointed 
academics.
Table 16: nGAP Budget Over the Six Phases

To  date,  UCT  has  received  R68.9  million  from  the  DHET  since  the  inception  of  the  programme, 
with the remaining R10.44 million under Phase 7 still to be received. The auditing over the period 
has  revealed  no  major  adverse  findings.  This  contribution  has  been  valuable  in  advancing  the 
transformation initiatives at the university. UCT is fully committed to the programme and at the end 
of 2021 a total of 32 appointments had been made with only one (1) resignation since the inception 
of  the  programme.  All  phase  1  candidates  have  completed  their  PhDs  and  have  now  been  fully 
integrated into their departments. Since they no longer constitute the nGAP budget, they now form 
part of the nGAP associates which implies that they continue to form part of the nGAP community 
during formal and informal engagements. The appointment process for phase 7 candidates will be 
completed in 2022.
UCT operates a cohort system within which nGAP lecturers are given opportunities to relate to one 
another, to develop networks, create new communities and in this way contribute to the energising 
of  a  more  equitable  and  harmonious  institutional  culture.  The  cohort  is  augmented  by  “associate” 
members who also attend functions – these are UCT academic staff members at a similar career 
stage as their NGAP colleagues. This approach is beneficial as it creates a larger mass of new, young, 
staff members and it maximises the value of the activities that are organised by the nGAP manager. 
Oversight of nGAP is conducted by a Steering Committee Chaired by the DVC Transformation with 
members  from  Finance,  HR,  and  the  Research  Office.  The  long-term  plan  for  the  university  is  to 
move the responsibility from 2022 to the Dean of CHED where the programme will be located. To 
encourage connection amongst nGAP lecturers and to raise the profile of its members, the nGAP 
manager regularly produces newsletters which are available on the UCT website.

INFRASTRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY GRANT

Teacher Education Building
This is a construction of a new Teacher Education building on the middle campus to accommodate 
an enlarged cluster. The allocation includes construction, equipment, and furniture. The conditional 
allocation by DHET of R55 million for a second middle campus building was premised on increased 
post-graduate enrolments in education. Since this constituted only a quarter of the estimated cost 
of the new building on the middle campus, UCT requested the use of the R55 million allocation for 
Teacher  Education  towards  acquiring  the  Rustenburg  Junior  School  (RGJS),  situated  on  the  Main 
Road in Rondebosch, adjacent to the College of Music and the University’s Baxter Theatre. This plan 
did not materialise. A return to our original plans, i.e., the enlarged cluster on the Middle Campus, is no 
longer possible given the insourcing and austerity measures introduced at UCT. Thus, we have had 
to revert to focusing solely on a building for Teacher Education utilising the original allocated amount 
of R55 million and the approved interest earned. The estimated New School of Education project 
budget including VAT is R92.9 million of which DHET has contributed R55 million; interest earned on 
unutilised funds contributed R15 million (approval to utilise the interest earned on the funds had been 
granted by the Department). The New School of Education is about to reach Practical Completion 
in early May 2022.

DHET Maintenance Backlog and Student Housing
Between 2015 and 2017, UCT received a total of R142.5 million for various backlog maintenance, 
priority maintenance and student housing. The R50 million allocation of infrastructure received in the 
funding of 2015/16, for the refurbishment of Rochester House, has been repurposed for COVID-19 
use, but specifically for the upgrade of existing HVAC units to include specific filters to trap airborne 
particles related to COVID-19. The academic buildings prioritised because of their maximum utilisation 
and capacity, can still be occupied. The total phase 4 spend was R69 million. A deferred maintenance 
project is planned for Rochester House residence in the second half of 2022. Six backlog maintenance 
contractors have been appointed via the UCT procurement processes, and 11 backlog maintenance 
packages have been allocated using an NEC4 framework agreement, option B. The initial condition 
assessments and planning have commenced.

The Chris Hani Lecture Theatre Building
Chris  Hani  Lecture  Theatre  building  –  previously  the  New  Science  Lecture  Theatre  –  was  built 
in  the  1960’s  as  a  large  lecture  theatre.  The  steeply  raked  lecture  theatre  was  not  conducive  to 
modern  teaching  methods.  This  building  occupies  prominent  space  on  UCT’s  Upper  Campus,  but 
the internal space was not efficiently used. The project intention was to repurpose the building to 
accommodate a large modern lecture theatre, flat floor study space, a general student centre where 
key  student  support  services  will  be  provided  and  a  science  student  learning  centre,  linked  to  a 
new science faculty administrative suite. To achieve this improvement in the efficiency of use of the 
building, an additional floor and mezzanine were added within the heritage external envelope which 
was retained. The relocation of the Science Faculty administrative suite from its current location will 
release valuable academic space elsewhere on campus. The science learning centre will be central to 
improved throughput and graduation numbers of students in the faculty of science.
The main contract was awarded in July 2020. The procurement schedule for this project is on track 
and  under  close  review  for  any  possible  delays  in  sourcing  material,  components,  and  equipment. 
All outstanding claims by the main contractor have been resolved. Health and Safety inspections are 
being conducted on a regular basis and there have been no reported COVID-19 cases to date.
Over the past year, the significant challenges included delays in receiving imported components such 
as the roof sheeting, and challenges closing out the specification for the furniture. There have been 
some extension of time claims from the contractor due to the roof, and other specifications. This 
project is about to achieve Practical Completion and occupancy in April 2022, and only snag items, 
installation of blinds, and some minor heritage plaster issues remain to be resolved. The project is 
being executed within the forecast budget.

Avenue Road Student Residence: R192 million (UCT contribution R100 million)  Continued
The first-tier residence represents phase one of a planned cluster of developments in this area, which 
and includes a separate multi-residence dining hall for first-year students. As there are houses on the 
site that are of heritage significance, UCT has obtained heritage approval to ensure the development 
does  not  detract  from  the  existing  buildings  on  the  site.  The  residence  has  achieved  a  four-star 
green rating from the Green Building Council South Africa (GBCSA) for its energy- and water-saving 
features – and includes a full suite of disability facilities. The development is being co-funded by the 
Department of Higher Education and Training with an additional R130 million from UCT.
Additional care has been taken to provide accommodation that offers universal access to students 
with physical and other disabilities. The residence has 12 universal access rooms: six assisted-living 
bedrooms. These rooms are interleading, providing accommodation for live-in carers. Although three 
other UCT residences have been retrofitted to provide similar facilities (one each at Graça Machel 
Hall, Leo Marquard and Woolsack), this will be a first for a new residence.
The three-storey residence has 144 single rooms and 173 double rooms. Phase two will be developed 
on land currently occupied by UCT family “barracks” opposite Mostert’s Mill, below the M3. This has 
been earmarked for the student dining hall. Phase three, a 300-bed residence, will be built on the 
Edwin Hart site. Practical Completion according to the JBCC building contract was achieved on 7 
December 2020 and Final Completion on 7 March 2021.

Water Sustainability Project
The severe drought a few years ago in the Western Cape prompted the initiation of this project. 
The project initially saw the development of UCT’s sustainable water management strategy in 2020, 
which has since moved into the design and implementation of various enabling projects, water saving 
projects and water recycling projects. Their progress is summarised below:
 » Groundwater investigation, borehole drilling, water flow and quality testing (99% complete).
 » Underground services detection, mapping, and digitisation of key areas on Upper and Middle/Lower 

Campus (80% complete for Upper Campus).

 » Digital water meter installation for individual buildings (67% complete).
 » Retrofitting  of  water  savings  fixtures  and  fittings  in  high  water  use  residences  (tender  process 

complete, appointment of contractors imminent for July and December 2022 vacation periods).

 » Centralised  water  recycling  project  for  Lower  Campus  residences  (concept  design  has  been 
developed, detailed stakeholder engagement underway to determine final acceptable location for 
the facility before detailed design begins).

This project will see these and other sub-projects implemented over the remaining three years that 
will result in millions of litres of municipal water being saved at UCT. It is expected that the progress on 
this project will improve due to effective procurement processes now in place and the challenges of 
working within a live teaching, learning and residence environment having been effectively mitigated 
by the project team.

DHET: ICTS Network Renewal Project
The “Network Renewal Project” commenced in March 2018, and it is a multi-year project and will 
extend into 2022 with a revised end date set for 31 December 2022. The project is partly funded 
by a Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) grant of R78 million, with the balance of 
the funding coming from a combination of Council-approved project funding (R30 million) and ICTS’s 
annual infrastructural life-cycle renewal funds (R60 million.) The DHET grant funding has been fully 
spent.
This project’s key objectives are to refresh the network architecture and infrastructure to:

Mitigate risk

by replacing end of life and/or support network infrastructure components

Increase

Improve

Facilitate

Sustain

the speed of the University network to cater for significant growth in bandwidth 
demand from the UCT research community

the  support,  monitoring,  security,  flexibility,  and  resilience  of  the  network 
infrastructure

the delivery of several advanced services that are likely to be required during the 
lifetime of the upgraded network

the  provision  of  ubiquitous  wireless  access  to  electronic  information  resources 
irrespective of location within the boundaries of the University campus

The  project,  since  commencement,  has  completed  the  renewal  of  the  network  core,  data  centre 
networks,  distribution  layer,  edge  connectivity,  implemented  NextGen  firewalls,  software  defined 
networking capabilities, monitoring, and revised edge connectivity. Resilience has been designed into 
the core, distribution and edge connectivity layers which allows for continued internet connectivity 
if failures should occur. Bandwidth of the SANREN connection, UCT inter- and internal data centre 
network,  as  well  as  that  of  the  distribution  and  access  layers  has  been  substantially  improved.  At 
commencement of the project UCT also required to replace the access layer across circa 159 sites 
comprising out of wired and wireless connectivity.
The project was on track until the occurrence of the pandemic and good progress had been made 
with the implementation of the access layer, which is the final objective to be achieved.

SENATE REPORTS TO COUNCIL

DHET: ICTS Network Renewal Project Continued
The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the project’s ability to implement the renewal of the 
access layer during 2020 and 2021. Key constraints were the general lock down with most if not 
all staff working from home. That translates into difficulties in accessing buildings and offices which 
have  been  locked  with  the  occupant  being  off-campus  leaving  the  project  unable  to  locate  keys 
and thus access areas within a building/site. Project staff themselves were at times due to legislative 
constraints restricted from accessing the campus. The need to ensure the safety of network staff and 
supporting companies working on the structured cabling and who assist with the placement of new 
wireless access points compounded the difficulties.
The UCT fire in April 2021 also impacted the progress of this project as our human resources which 
had been assigned to this project were deployed to assess the damage to the access layer at the 
affected 18 building sites. All these sites had been upgraded (as part of the project) prior to the fire 
and the access layer of the fire damaged sites (nine sites) had to be re-implemented. This resulted in 
rework in nine sites.
To address the delays caused by the pandemic and the UCT fire, UCT had to revise the access layer 
component  of  the  network  renewal  plan  and  obtained  approval  from  the  project  implementation 
committee to do so. The end date was revised from December 2021 to December 2022 and the 
focus  was  placed  on  renewing  the  access  layer  of  all  residences  to  accommodate  the  return  of 
students  to  campus  and  sites  where  unsupported  wireless  access  points  (WAP)  needed  urgent 
replacement due to them having reached end of support and life. The project continues to adjust 
its  implementation  plan  as  best  it  can  in  response  to  the  dynamic  and  uncertain  circumstances 
notwithstanding the constraints mentioned in this report and noting the nine sites which had to be 
redone due to the fire. Over 30 sites were completed during 2021.
Current  project  status  is  at  an  estimated  91%  completion  with  the  infrastructure  life-cycle  phase 
focusing on the access-layer at an 76% complete. Of the circa 149 sites that required renewal, about 
28 sites remain which require various levels of renewal of the access layer. It is envisaged that these 
remaining sites will be completed before end of 2022.

2020 was the year in which UCT’s research strategy shifted gear, 
transitioning from the outgoing Strategic Planning Framework 
(2016–2020) to developing and implementing Vision 2030.

There  are  three  annual  Senate  Reports  to  Council,  namely  the  Teaching  and  Learning  Report, 
the  Report  on  Research  and  the  Social  Responsiveness  Report.  The  2020  Research  Report  was 
approved by Council on 19 June 2020, and the 2020 Teaching and Learning Report was approved 
by Council on 4 December 2021. The 2020/2021 Social Responsiveness Report was approved by

THE 2020 REPORT ON RESEARCH 
TO SENATE AND COUNCIL

Introduction
2020 was the year in which UCT’s research strategy shifted gear, transitioning from the outgoing 
Strategic  Planning  Framework  (2016–2020)  to  developing  and  implementing  Vision  2030. 
UCT’s research is well on track for becoming an inclusive, engaged and research-intensive African 
university.  Its  2030  research  vision  is  premised  on  a  strategic  intent  to  generate  new  knowledge 
in Afrika, for Afrika and from Afrika that seeks to co-create a sustainable global future. To achieve 
this  requires  disciplinary  depth  and  dynamic  inter-  and  transdisciplinary  teams,  functioning  in  a 
facilitating  environment.  Thus,  UCT  has  developed  a  framework  of  excellence,  which  foregrounds 
transformation, productivity, sustainability and societal impact. The framework asks four questions: 
Is our research transformative? What is the level and nature of our productivity? What is the impact 
of our research, in South Africa, Africa and globally? Are we ensuring that our excellent research is 
sustainable? Going forward, UCT intends to develop its Africa-focused, innovative, research-intensive 
agenda  built  on  strong  disciplines  and  harnessing  inter-  and  transdisciplinary  research  that  delivers 
relevant new knowledge and societal, environmental and economic impacts towards a fair and just 
society. In addition, there are essential elements – facilities, infrastructure, policies and procedures, 
and support structures – that must be in place to achieve these aspirations.

THE 2020 REPORT ON RESEARCH TO 
SENATE AND COUNCIL Continued

COVID-19
In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic caused setbacks and stresses to UCT’s research activities during 
which fieldwork, on which much research is based, was interrupted for many months; experimental and 
performing arts and culture platforms were not accessible for research; and laboratories not actively 
focused on COVID-19 research were closed for four to six months – with all the associated challenges 
of getting these functional again. This has slowed the progress of much of UCT’s research, impacting 
the timelines for intellectual property registration, for research postgraduate students to complete 
their  studies  and  for  research  findings  to  be  validated  and  reported.  This  situation  has  brought 
financial challenges, and the cost of COVID-19 has impacted the now austere funding landscapes. At 
the same time UCT researchers responded strongly to contribute to knowledge generation and its 
implementation through clinical initiatives, diagnostic reagents and approaches, vaccine development, 
medical  devices,  protective  equipment,  understanding  behavioural  responses,  analysing  pandemic 
trends for predictive responses and analysing economic and societal impact. A Scopus search on 
UCT contributions related to COVID-19 published in 2020, yielded 240 peer-reviewed journal papers 
on the topic. Despite the challenges, many research support units and researchers reported positive 
outcomes of the forced shift to working virtually. For example, outdated cumbersome paper-based 
processes were moved to online systems; online events had greater success rates than before; there 
were savings on travel costs which had a positive impact on the environment.

Excellence
In 2020 UCT hosted a large share of national funding instruments aimed at strengthening research 
leadership.  These  include  42  NRF-DSI  SARChI  Chairs,  three  DSI-NRF  Centres  of  Excellence,  and 
two Africa-focused ARUA Centres of Excellence. These centres provide critical capacity for training 
the  next  generation  of  researchers  and  generating  cutting-edge  research.  UCT’s  2015–2019  top 
10  research  clusters,  demonstrated  by  “prominence”  (a  measure  of  areas  of  growth  measured  by 

In terms of World University Rankings, in 2020 UCT remained the top 
African university in four global rankings

bibliometrics)  and  indicated  by  key  words  linked  to  outputs  are  as  follows:  HIV;  Decay  (Quarks, 
Neutrinos);  Tuberculosis;  Galaxies;  Birds;  Africa;  Fisheries;  Health;  Women;  Obesity;  and  Climate 
Models.
In  terms  of  World  University  Rankings,  in  2020  UCT  remained  the  top  African  university  in  four 
global rankings: 103rd in the US News & World Report Best Global Universities Rankings; 155th in 
the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings; 220th in the Quacquarelli Symonds 
(QS) World University Rankings and 268th in the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) and 
10th in the Times Higher Education (THE) Emerging Economies University Rankings. Research areas 
ranked in the top 100 globally were Infectious Diseases – ninth (US News & World Report Best Global 
Universities Rankings); Development Studies – 10th (Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings); 
Sport Science – 47th (Shanghai Special Focus Institution Rankings); Oceanography – 48th (Shanghai 
Ranking’s  Global  Rankings  of  Academic  Subjects);  and  Clinical  and  Health  –  66th  (Times  Higher 
Education (THE) World University Rankings).

Researchers
In 2020 UCT hosted 11 419 postgraduate students of whom 53% were female, and 338 postdoctoral 
fellows of whom 29% were black South African and 43% international. When academics are defined 
as all permanent and T2 contract staff (including soft-funded academic research staff), UCT’s staff 
composition for 2020 was 67% South African, 51% female and 30% black South African. In terms 
of career stages these included 19% professors, 19% associate professors, 28% senior lecturers and 
30% lecturers. Individual awards, including three new P-ratings (nine in all), three new A-ratings and 
four  renewed  A-ratings,  speaks  to  the  calibre  of  UCT’s  researchers.  A  further  three  researchers 
appeared on Clarivate as highly cited researchers in 2020. With regard to NRF-DSI SARChI Chairs, 
UCT’s 42 chairs comprise 17% of the national total. In terms of NRF ratings, UCT academics make up 
12% of NRF-rated researchers nationally, 25% of A-rated researchers and 39% of P-rated researchers. 
Overall,  however,  UCT’s  NRF-rated  researchers  have  declined  from  542  in  2016  to  500  in  2020 
owing to decreased funding incentives to being rated.
Regarding knowledge dissemination, UCT is committed to open science and to nurturing open access 
publishing. In 2020, UCT supported open access publishing through 132 awards and through BioMed 
Central (BMC) membership, costing a total of R3 million which was UCT supplemented directly by 
researchers. There has also been progress in discussions on returning UCT Press to the university as 
a predominantly open access press. To further open access publishing, UCT has established an open 
access publishing platform, OpenUCT and an open data repository, ZivaHub.

Research Capacity Development
UCT  recognises  the  need  for  continued  investment  in  the  development  of  its  researchers,  and  in 
providing an enabling environment that allows them to flourish. UCT continues to build its capabilities 
to “lift as we rise” through mentorship programmes, the Researcher Development Academy, building 
the  academic  career  path,  facilitating  new  academics  to  become  research  active  and  building 
initiatives such as the grant writing hub.
UCT researchers are also participating actively in nationally supported initiatives that support early-
career researchers, such as the Black Academic Advancement Programme. In 2020 UCT submitted 
eight applications for 2021: three for Doctoral Sabbatical Grants and five for Postdoctoral Sabbatical 
Grants  –  all  were  successful.  The  DHET’s  Future  Professors  Programme  prepares  promising  early 
career academics to become the new cohort of South African professors. In 2020, two out of five 
UCT applicants were successful.
Access  to  research  funding  is  crucial  for  improving  researchers’  profiles  and  professional  standing. 
The Research Office has built a research development pipeline to support UCT’s researchers at all 
stages of their careers. These are summarised below: Postdoctoral Research Fellows benefit from 

seminars and workshops from the Office of Postgraduate Studies and funding from the Postgraduate 
Funding  Office.  The  Junior  Research  Fellows  (JRFs)  programme  is  funded  through  the  Research 
Strategic Fund as a pilot initiative providing an opportunity for URC-accredited research groupings 
with  interdisciplinary  research  agendas  to  host  junior  research  fellows  on  three-year  T2  contracts. 
In 2020 six three-year JRFs valued at R658 000 each were made to the value of R3.9 million as 
well as ten top-ups at R158 000 each. Of the 15 fellows appointed to date, nine are black and nine 
are female. Early career academics benefit from the Emerging Researcher Programme (ERP) which 
is  funded  through  the  Vice  Chancellor’s  Strategic  Fund  and  the  Department  of  Higher  Education 
and  Training’s  (DHET)  University  Capacity  Development  Grant.  Through  the  ERP,  the  Research 
Office offers support and training for fund-raising (including the International Grants Hub), research 
integrity, eResearch, research contracts and innovation and rating applications, as well as access to 
the  Engaged  Researcher  Programme.  In  2021,  of  new  participating  academics  on  the  ERP,  48% 
were  African  South  Africans,  14%  were  Coloured  South  Africans  and  8%  were  international.  59% 
of new ERP members were female, which 41% were male. It is noteworthy that 53.1% of all ad hom 
promotions awarded in 2020 went to ERP members. Additionally, 70 of the 96 academics who were 
promoted  in  2020  had  attended  one  or  more  ERP  seminars/workshops  in  the  past  three  years. 
The Researcher Development Academy (RDA) was established to offer researcher training to sister 
universities  in  South  Africa  and  on  the  continent.  Relatedly,  the  RDA  developed  the  Researcher 
Development Framework to jointly design a programme with sister institutions to promote long-term 
partnerships.  The  2030  Future  Leaders  Project  is  supported  through  the  VC’s  Strategic  Fund.  It 
aims to support and retain a small cohort of exceptionally talented early career researchers. In 2020, 
R5.9 million was granted by the VC for a further three researchers to join the existing cohort of 15. 
The Building Research Active Academic Staff (BRAAS) is another pilot project funded through the 
Research Strategic Fund. It supports new staff to develop supervision expertise and begin building a 
research team. In 2020, R2.3 million was awarded to 17 new early-career, academic staff were each 
allocated a bursary for a master’s research student for two years. In addition, 47 master’s bursaries 
allocated in 2019 were renewed for a second year.
Established academics continue to benefit from a range of services offered through the Research 
Office, including support for NRF-rating applications (67 application were submitted in 2020), access 
to  the  international  grants  hub  (including  the  Enabling  Grant  Seeker  Excellence  Awards),  research 
integrity  training,  eResearch,  research  contracts  and  innovation  support.  The  Senior  Research 
Scholars (SRS) programme enables post-retirement associates to help UCT maintain its international 
profile  and  grow  the  next  generation  of  academics  through  retaining  their  publication  output  and 
supervision skills. By December 2020 thirty senior research scholars had been appointed.

UCT recognises the need for continued investment in the development 
of its researchers, and in providing an enabling environment that allows 
them to flourish.

Research Income
Total  research  income  in  2020  amounted  to  R1  643  million,  of  which  R1  516  million  was  from 
sources  external  to  UCT.  The  external  income  received  showed  a  7.5%  decrease,  equivalent 
to  R123  million,  compared  to  2019.  This  decrease  was  largely  due  to  a  decrease  in  NRF-related 
income and other local, largely public sector, funding. However, there was a slight increase (of 8%) 
in foreign income which accounts for more than 60% of total research income, up from 53% in 2019. 
Contract  income  continues  to  contribute  at  least  two-thirds  of  the  total  external  research  income 
(R1.15 billion, a decrease of 4% compared to 2019’s R1.2 billion). The biggest contributors to such 
contract income for 2020 are the National Institutes of Health (13.6%), SA Medical Research Council 
(5%),  Bill  &  Melinda  Gates  Foundation  (4.5%),  Fred  Hutchinson  Cancer  Research  (2.6%)  and  the 
Wellcome Trust (2.2%). The NRF remains the single biggest funder of research at UCT, contributing 
R270 million. This accounts for about 20% of total external research income. In 2020 UCT earned 
a  further  R253  million  for  publication  subsidies  from  the  DHET.  However,  in  2020,  NRF  research 
income dropped by about R65 million (circa 20% decrease compared to 2019). The areas impacted 
the most include the SARChI programme, National Equipment Programme, the Centres of Excellence, 
Competitive Support Programmes and international cooperation agreements. Donations decreased 
by R4.5 million (5%) to R85.5 million compared to 2019 (R90 million).
UCT has a range of innovation funding instruments from very early pre-seed right through to early-stage 
venture capital funding, that it either manages internally or is specifically linked to. Innovation funding 
is closely linked with commercialisation and the development of spin-off companies and sits within 
the Research Contracts and Innovation Office (RC&I). UCT filed 64 new patent applications in 2020. 
Two new spin-off companies were registered, bringing UCT’s portfolio to 24 operational companies. 
In all, 23 licences were issued, R2.1 million was earned from licensing IP Rights and over R100 million 
estimated from the equity value of nine spin-off companies. A positive consequence of the formation 
of spin-off UCT companies is the number of jobs created for UCT graduates either as entrepreneurial 
founders or as employees.
In 2020 UCT signed 1 793 research contracts valued at R2.18 billion (R1.77 billion in 2019) of which 
R1.6  billion  (77%)  was  earned  by  foreign  contracts  and  R512  million  (8%)  was  from  local  sources. 
However,  this  overall  23%  increase  was  largely  due  to  an  influx  of  COVID-19-related  contracts  in 
the Faculty of Health Sciences. In 2020 UCT’s total research income was R1.64 billion with a further 
R1.52 billion earned from external sources (but with an 8% reduction in funding income from external 
sources due largely to COVID restrictions on research activity). Thus, although research contracts 
signed in 2020 increased by 23% to R2.18 billion, the increase was largely due to COVID-19 specific 

calls that were mostly secured by health science-related projects. In 2020, to mitigate the impact of 
the pandemic, immediate relief funding for the research community was mobilised through Council 
support for soft-funded researcher salaries. In addition, the URC supported 32 postdoctoral fellows 
affected by the pandemic to the value of R3.8 million to extend their fellowships.
UCT incentivises targeted research thrusts from internal funding sources. In 2020 UCT researchers 
benefitted from R61.3 million from the URC and R26.5 million allocated for strategic research projects. 
The VC’s Strategic Fund awarded R5.9 million to the 2030 Future Leaders Project, R4.5 million to the 
Advancing Womxn Project and R900 000 to the now completed Decoloniality Project. And seven 
young academics received the College of Fellows Young Researcher Award.
Overall, research income in 2020 decreased by 8% compared with 2019, following growth of 2.5% 
between 2018 and 2019. The 2020 decrease was largely in national income and can be attributed 
to research delays and cuts due the COVID-19 pandemic. Cuts in national (NRF, DSI) and UK ODA 
(Official  Developmental  Assistance)  funding  as  well  as  a  general  tightening  of  research  funding 
globally. This suggests that significant effort will be required to sustain the funding level of UCT’s 
research enterprise moving forward. To this end the Research Office has put in place measures such 
as  the  International  Grants  Hub  and  incentives  to  assist  researchers  in  sustaining  funded  research 
programmes in this challenging environment. The International Grants Hub has been instrumental in 
supporting early career researchers in applying and securing prestigious FLAIR fellowships, with 11 of 
33 submissions progressing to the interview stage in 2020. Securing funding for UCT’s Vision 2030 
research enterprise will be one of the key challenges moving forward. For example, UCT needs to 
recognise the contribution of its soft-funded researchers and provide them with better security. UCT 
also needs to continue to build its transformative research capacity and sustain its role as a key player 
in building knowledge in, for and from Africa with global reach and impact.

conducting systematic reviews. The Digital Library Service (DLS) unit offers a range of research data 
management services to assist researchers with organising, managing and sharing their research data, 
to facilitate its preservation and access for present and future use. This includes sharing and publishing 
research  data  on  UCT’s  data  repository  (ZivaHub).  Furthermore,  UCT  Libraries  is  committed  to 
supporting the digital humanities in South Africa by providing technical support and training to assist 
researchers with archiving and preserving material.

Quality Assurance and Research Assessment, Ethics Compliance and Risk Management
Research  assessment  at  UCT  takes  the  form  of  ratings  by  external  agencies;  quality-driven 
accreditation  and  regular  review  requirements  for  UCT’s  formal  URC  accredited  reviews  of  its 
research groupings. A key strength of UCT’s research is its accredited research groupings and their 
quality assurance system that includes qualitative and quantitative measures and is based on external 
peer review and stakeholder engagement. Regarding research assessment, UCT subscribes to the 
San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) principles which ensure that research 
assessment is not exclusively based on journal-based metrics, but also assesses the research on its 
own merits including the use of technology to enhance scholarly communication and evaluation of 
research impact.

Research Support Tools and Infrastructure
To sustain UCT’s research enterprise both appropriate research support and funding are required. UCT 
has identified the need for efficient and agile research finance and HR systems to ensure research 
compliance and excellent due diligence. Furthermore, UCT needs to provide appropriate infrastructure 
for research through the libraries, knowledge repositories, computing facilities, appropriately equipped 
laboratories,  workshops  and  studios,  and  access  to  research  funding.  Attention  is  currently  being 
given to streamlining research administration, particularly finance, HR and contract administration. This 
is being led by the electronic Research Administration (eRA) programme. Comprising a small team of 
service managers based in ICTS, Libraries and the Research Office, eResearch operates across the 
research enterprise to respond to the challenges of technological developments and new legislation 
and  policies.  Its  mandate  is  to  manage  the  entire  research  administration  lifecycle  for  researchers 
and administrative staff, as well as to provide comprehensive reporting. eRA has worked to ensure 
that research-supporting PASS departments provide a holistic approach to research support. The 
focus for 2020, the final year of the project, was on data integrity and harvesting master data from 
source systems. This concludes the implementation of the main modules of the eRA project, including 
researcher profiles, publications and awards (pre-awards, contracts and post-awards). In 2020, training 
and support for the eRA system was seamlessly moved over to online platforms.
Additional  services  that  support  UCT’s  research  include  ICTs  that  provide  high-speed  network 
connectivity, advanced computational resources and data storage facilities and information and cyber 
security.
Open science is the practice of making research outputs – publications, data and software codes, 
available  in  a  way  that  is  findable,  accessible,  interoperable  and  reusable  (FAIR).  This  practice  is 
increasingly popular among researchers and mandated by funders. OpenUCT, the university’s open-
access repository, offers researchers a stable and reliable record of their work, which is managed and 
stored through UCT’s Libraries to meet international technical standards. The Libraries bibliometrics 
service  provides  support  for  demonstrating  research  impact.  Librarians  also  assist  with  identifying 

A key strength of UCT’s research is its accredited research groupings and 
their quality assurance system

Research Integrity and Ethics
The  Office  of  Research  Integrity  (ORI)  in  the  Research  Office  works  to  ensure  the  policies  and 
practices governing research integrity at UCT align with international norms and standards. A key 
project  for  the  ORI  in  2020  was  the  development  and  delivery  of  online  responsible  conduct  of 
research  training  courses.  The  Ethics  Governance  Review  Committee  (EGRC)  was  established  to 
review research ethics processes at UCT and to establish an ethics module in the eRA system to be 
used across the university. The committee completed its work in 2020 with its final recommendation 
to  retain  all  faculty  committees  and  work  towards  implementing  a  risk-based  approach  to  ethics 
review. With input from the EGRC, the ORI has developed a UCT Risk-based Ethics Review Guideline 
now available to all UCT researchers. Providing support for research misconduct investigations was 
ongoing  in  2020.  The  first  UCT  Research  Fairness  Initiative  (RFI)  draft  report  was  completed  in 
December 2020 for submission to the RFI Task Group for comment.

Risk Management
The risk policy framework, accepted by Council in November 2010, designates the URC as “watch 
dog” for the monitoring of research-related risks. In 2020, UCT faced challenges due to the growing 
size  and  complexity  of  its  research  enterprise,  the  legacy  of  fragmented  business  processes  and 
systems, and new policies and changes in legislation and regulations. Risk challenges identified by the 
URC include:
 » Changes in the NRF funding landscape, that impacts on UCT’s ability to retain top researchers 
including the Heads of Centres of Excellence and SARChI Chairs as well as the retention of soft-
funded academic research staff (SFARS). For example, 2020 saw unexpected budget cuts for two 
DSI-NRF Centres of Excellence. Further, and the funding cycles for 23 of UCT’s 42 SARChI Chairs 
will come to an end during 2021–2025. In response UCT has established the Encouraging Grant 
Seeker Enabling (EGSE) award to incentivise researchers to diversify their sources of funding. But 
an additional risk to manage here is the volatility of the foreign funding landscape.

 » As  noted  above,  research  compliance  remains  an  ongoing  risk  challenge  that  speaks  to 
institutional governance practices, rather than research governance. During 2020, the Executive 
Research  Compliance  task  team  continued  its  work  to  address  compliance  deficiencies  in  the 
health  and  safety,  and  biosafety  spheres.  The  Ethics  Governance  Review  Committee  also 
completed its work in 2020 introducing a risk-based approach to faculty ethics review processes 
and  committees.  It  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  new  inter-faculty  research  ethics 
committee to ensure adequate ethical appraisal of transdisciplinary research and high-risk projects.
 » Maintenance of UCT’s research equipment infrastructure is a third area of risk. Funding for the 
UEC was recently relocated to UCT’s Capital Expenditure budget, which in principle offers greater 
flexibility to meet research requirements.

Social Responsiveness Report 2020/21
The  Social  Responsiveness  Report  2020/21  is  a  themed  report  that  provides  an  overview  of 
activities that the UCT community engaged in, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. The report contains 
examples of scholarship and professional expertise used to benefit the wider community, both locally, 
provincially, nationally, and throughout Africa. Many UCT scholars conducted community-engaged 
research  and  outreach  focused  on  COVID-19  awareness  and  education,  addressing  widespread 
misinformation and providing evidence-based responses to the disease. New collaborations emerged 
between universities, between scholars across disciplines and between scholars and various spheres 
of government and community-based organisations.
Faculties’ submissions revealed UCT has been deeply involved in responding to this health crises from 
a research perspective, providing health care and support, (doctors and students at the frontline), in 
the education sector , through to innovation in various research projects in terms of direct support to 
communities and redirecting funding to support vulnerable communities during this crises. Significantly, 
submissions also revealed that UCT staff and students have increasingly embraced the imperative 
that SR should underpin our work.

Social Responsiveness Report 2020/21 Continued
Resilience:  Some  faculty  projects  managed  to  weather  the  storm  and  carry  out  their  social 
responsiveness work in new and more innovative formats. Examples are listed below:
 » The  African  Gender  Institute,  the  Centre  for  Theatre,  Dance,  and  Performance  Studies  with 
the  Sex  Worker  Education  &  Advocacy  Task  Force  (SWEAT  produced  a  performance  titled 
COVID Waarheid (COVID’s Truth)).

 » The Environmental and Geographical Sciences (EGS) One Ocean Hub research team in collaboration 
with  Rhodes  University  One  Ocean  Hub  Emphatheatre  Group  established  the  Coastal  Social 
Justice Network WhatsApp group for 20 fisher leaders that enabled them to share information 
and request assistance on a range of COVID-19 and fishery-related challenges.

 » A  partnership  between  EBE,  the  Municipal  Infrastructure  Support  Agent  (MISA)  and  Engineers 
Without Borders South Africa (EWB-SA) provided a platform for 38 engineering students working 
in virtual teams to provide input to the Data for Municipal Infrastructure Assets (Data4MIA) initiative 
with  the  students  analysing  and  compiling  data  to  drive  well-informed  decision-making  around 
infrastructure priorities and spending at a municipal level.

 » The  Faculty  of  Health  Sciences  continued 

its  services  to  vulnerable  populations  with 
HIV and TB under strict health protocols and ensured that community sites were kept informed of 
COVID-related safety measures.

 » School Development Unit (SDU) redesigned and reconceptualised its interventions to address the 
needs  of  the  schools  in  support  of  the  Western  Cape  Education  Department’s  implementation 
of the Revised Annual Teaching Plans and introduced several psychosocial support strategies for 
learners and teachers.

 » Schools  Improvement  Initiative  (SII)  in  collaboration  with  Occupational  Therapy  (OT)  and 
Speech-Language  Therapy  (SLT)  advocated  for  the  use  of  see-through  masks  for  disabled 
children.

 » The Perinatal Mental Health Project (PMHP) co-founded a coalition, Messages4Mothers, to develop 
and disseminate accessible information for mothers on physical and mental health, parenting and 
mindfulness via several languages and a range of multimedia platforms.

 » The Faculty of Health Sciences reported on the activities of dedicated staff and students who put 
their personal safety and lives at risk to support the faculty’s social responsiveness engagement. 
This included academics from the Division of Family Medicine, the Division of Emergency Medicine 
and the Primary Health Care Directorate working in clinical management teams at the “Hospital of 
Hope” – the field hospital set up in the Cape Town International Conference Centre.

 » CILT staff worked tirelessly to develop new IT resources to support staff and students with online 

teaching and learning.

 » The pandemic also provided an opportunity for academics to empower communities through the 
media. Various academics contributed to printed media and gave talks on local radio stations on 
topics such as mental health, wellbeing, parenting and self-care in the time of COVID-19.

Opportunities: The pandemic opened new research paths for some academics. For example:
 » The  School  of  Economics  developed  a  micro-simulation  model  of  COVID-19  to  show  the  roles 
of  behaviour  and  socio-economic  inequality  in  the  transmission  of  COVID-19.  The  School  also 
developed the Covi-id, an initiative to preserve privacy via QR codes for contact tracing.

 » Research on Economics of Excisable Products (REEP) conducted a large online survey to test the 
effect of the government’s ban on the sale of cigarettes on smokers’ behaviour. They concluded that 
the sales ban had largely failed; it entrenched a virulent illicit market and smokers were more likely to 
share cigarettes during lockdown exacerbating the risk of contracting the virus.

 » The Development Policy Research Unit (DPRU)’s research fed into state decisions on the extension 
of social grants, including the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant (SRD) and the Employment 
Tax Incentive (ETI) as well as the COVID-19 Country Report run by the Department of Planning, 
Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) with the National Research Foundation (NRF).

 » The Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) made a major input to the 

Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC), leading to an increase in the Child Support Grant.

 » The Division of Biomedical Engineering, developed “OpenAir” a low cost ventilator that (with CSIR 
and UCT’s Clinical Skills Centre) won SAHPRA approval for the production of ventilators in South 
Africa.

 » The Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine (IDM) played a leading role in a national 
initiative to provide “surge” diagnostic testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2. The IDM’s testing protocol 
achieved a turnaround time of approximately 12 hours and successfully delivered more than 6 000 
tests during the peak of the epidemic.

Conclusions
The pandemic revealed the importance of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary work; survival under 
lockdown  involved  far  more  than  epidemiology  –  it  also  demanded  attention  to  gender  relations, 
race  and  discrimination,  digital  access,  police  brutality  and  the  exacerbated  and  brutal  effects  of 
poverty, unemployment and inequality. The pandemic forced us to ask deep questions about the 
role of the university as a publicly funded social institution. UCT has defined social responsiveness 
as more than volunteer outreach and has emphasised the importance of engagement and putting 
knowledge to work to address pressing social and economic issues. This approach underlines the 
interconnectedness between research, teaching, and social engagement.

2020 TEACHING AND LEARNING REPORT

Introduction
This report, prepared by the Teaching and Learning Committee of Senate, reflects on undergraduate 
teaching and learning at the University of Cape Town between March and December 2020. It focuses 
on  what  UCT  achieved  in  order  to  continue  offering  undergraduate  education  under  pandemic 
conditions.
UCT completed the implementation of the 2016–2020 Strategic Planning Framework with critical 
achievements in the areas of inclusivity and transformation of the student body. In the five years 
since the implementation of the 2016 Admissions Policy, 41% of UCT undergraduate students are 
“first  in  family”  and  19.6%  come  from  disadvantaged  communities.  The  period  2015  to  2017  had 
shown the impact of the vicious cycle of lack of funding, mental health problems and poor academic 
performance  on  students  coming  from  disadvantaged  homes.  In  2018  and  2019,  a  number  of 
systems were flagged for development to provide a more responsive learning experience, including 
the professionalisation of student advice and the enhancing of data analytics capabilities to better 
monitor  student  performance.  Since  2018,  University  resources  and  donor  funding  were  invested 
in  all  these  areas.  However,  the  data  analyses  reported  in  the  2020  Teaching  &  Learning  Report 
unambiguously  confirmed  what  was  exacerbated  by  the  pandemic,  namely  that  socioeconomic 
conditions are a fundamental variable for academic performance, and in this case affected students’ 
capacities to adapt to online learning. We take this to mean that in the South African context, good-
quality education must disrupt social inequality.

The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Teaching and Learning
The  emergence  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  March  2020  catapulted  UCT  into  a  new  mode 
of  delivery  of  teaching  and  learning  that  would  ordinarily  have  taken  years  to  achieve.  UCT  was 
successful in switching to emergency remote teaching (ERT) and completed the academic year online. 
While the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted problems and gaps in UCT’s infrastructure, organisation, 
delivery and conceptualisation of teaching and learning, it also provided opportunities to test possible 
solutions. UCT had to rethink its governance and management of teaching and learning, staff had 
to  get  to  know  their  students’  lived  experiences  and  contexts  better  and  to  grapple  with  how  to 
support learning in difficult and resource-poor conditions. This led to the creation of new services to 
respond to and support students. Furthermore, staff had to learn very quickly how to use technology 
for  teaching  and  shifted  their  pedagogic  practices  accordingly.  While  there  were  many  positive 
outcomes to UCT’s attempts to respond to the crisis, some challenges remain – mostly due to their 
scale and structural nature. Below we highlight key shifts that occurred in teaching and learning in 
2020 to manage the situation caused by the pandemic.

The Management and Governance of Teaching and Learning During COVID-19
The sudden shift to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) and the uncertainty related to the progression 
of the pandemic and corresponding state regulations, required a responsive, flexible, consultative and 
cross-institutional forum that could make and re-make quick strategic and policy decisions and monitor 
their implementation. This led to the constitution of the Teaching Online Task Team (TOTT). TOTT’s 
purpose was to provide leadership to UCT in relation to the roll-out of undergraduate online teaching 
under  COVID-19  conditions.  Under  the  tireless  and  consultative  leadership  of  the  DVC:  Teaching 
and Learning, A/Prof Lis Lange, TOTT developed as a point of reference and deliberation for those 
grappling with the demands of ERT across all levels and spaces of the institution. The composition 
of TOTT included affected stakeholders – students, academic and faculty representatives and staff 
from support services including CHED, ICTS, Libraries, Student Wellness as well as representatives 
from the Academics Union the Black Academic Caucus. TOTT reported regularly as a permanent 
agenda item to the Teaching and Learning Committee of Senate to maintain system coherence. In 
April 2020, Senate approved a Framework for Teaching and Learning during COVID-19 drawn up 
through  the  TOTT  that  included  an  extension  of  the  academic  calendar,  a  recalibrated  curriculum 
based on 30 hours of study a week, specifications for asynchronous, low bandwidth delivery and 
outlines  on  how  the  academic  integrity  of  UCT’s  courses  and  assessments  would  be  maintained 
under ERT. The framework encouraged as much flexibility as possible within existing degree rules, 
for  example,  UCT’s  Senate  later  approved  the  flexible  management  of  students’  Duly  Performed 
(DPs) and the suspension of academic exclusions for 2020. Towards the end of the year, following 
international  trends  and  local  discussions,  the  TOTT  debated  and  developed  a  Framework  for 
Physically Distanced Learning in 2021 which was approved by Senate in November 2020.
The executive made use of the COVID-19 fund set up by Council to help UCT deal with the financial 
costs of the pandemic. The DHET also redirected some of its allocated funds to support the teaching 
and learning effort during 2020. This additional funding was used to provide laptops to students and 
data to students and staff, to provide extra tutor support to struggling students and to cover the 
costs of distributing hard copy material for the Distance Learning Project.

2020 TEACHING AND LEARNING REPORT Continued

The Use of Technology in Teaching
While  Vula  (UCT’s  online  learning  and  collaboration  system)  had  been  in  existence  for  15  years, 
there was still a large proportion of academics who used it only as a repository. From April 2020, 
all academics had to learn how to use Vula to teach. The Centre for Innovation in Learning & Teaching 
(CILT) in CHED played a crucial role preparing academics to implement ERT. CILT delivered more than 
100 interactive webinar sessions for staff to support teaching online. They also developed a suite of 
guidelines and resources for digitally enabled teaching and course design. All guidelines are available 
under Creative Commons licences and are now used by other universities in South Africa, Africa and 
globally. In the second semester of 2020, CILT offered a four-week online short course, the Design 
Studio, and a course design checklist for assuring the quality of blended or online course design. The 
shift to ERT also involved several technical and infrastructure upgrades including a transcription and 
captions service suitable for low-bandwidth environments.

Data Analytics
Data  analytics  work  had  been  circumscribed  to  a  handful  of  courses  that  impeded  graduation. 
During 2020, the Data Analytics for Students Success (DASS) project developed a course analytics 
dashboard  for  course  convenors  including  the  identification  of  those  students  not  participating 
adequately  online.  DASS  extended  its  work  to  all  courses  with  more  than  20  student  enrolments 
and demonstrated how the visualisation of data could enable academics to understand, monitor and 
manage student performance in their courses.

Assessment
In the area of assessment, academics in most faculties were forced to replace invigilated examinations 
with  other  forms  of  assessment.  The  Assessment  Framework  Working  Group  (AFWG)  reporting 
to  TOTT  examined  approaches  to  support  online  assessment  integrity.  It  produced  a  discussion 
document titled “Remote Teaching Assessment: Quality and Integrity” that focused on strategies for 
improving assessment integrity and analytical techniques for flagging unusual patterns indicative of 
cheating. However, the work of the AFWG shows that the rise of academic dishonesty in the online 
space is better mitigated by improved design of assessments rather than surveillance measures such 
as  online  proctoring.  While  we  cannot  make  evidence-based  claims  about  the  quality  of  learning 
outcomes during 2020, we can say that, while some will return to invigilated exams, many academics 
have  changed  their  assessment  practices  for  the  better  and  do  not  intend  to  return  to  traditional 
assessment practices.

Curriculum Change
In  the  area  of  curriculum,  UCT  is  less  sanguine  about  the  depth  and  extent  of  change.  Given  the 
pressures  to  move  pedagogic  practices  online,  most  academics  just  worked  with  already  existing 
curriculum content. However, many academics observed that ERT had forced them to think more 
consciously about their teaching in ways they had not done before. CILT’s guidelines took academics 
through the sequencing and structuring of teaching and learning activities in ways that undoubtedly 
improved pedagogy at the course level. What remains to be done is to tackle curriculum reform at 
programme level.

Cross-unit and Departmental Integration
The integration between professional and academic departments in TOTT and the constitution of its 
working groups and task teams across areas of expertise provided opportunities for units such as 
CILT and the ADP in CHED to extend the reach of their expertise across departments and faculties.

The Creation of New Service Offerings
Managing the pandemic was a catalyst for creating new services such as UCT_Cares, that will remain 
and become embedded in UCT’s “normal” service provision. UCT Cares is a helpdesk and referral 
system that serves as a central point of contact for students from any faculty with any problem that 
can be redirected. It is designed as a system that allows students to log queries easily and query 
handlers to analyse the query before referring it appropriately. Since its launch in April until the end 
of 2020, UCT_Cares handled 437 queries with 25% of queries handled at the first point of contact 
and 75% referred to the UCT support network. The largest category of queries (over 30%) dealt 
with appeals for a return to residence. In 2021, UCT Cares will develop faculty-based nodes with 
trained peer advisors, a UCT_Cares counsellor for interrogation and referral of mental health queries, 
UCT_Cares Reach (a protocol for locating and contacting students on request from the faculties) and 
the UCT_Cares bot, a pilot chatbot that will test the application of automated advising tools at UCT.

A Different Perspective on Teaching Assistants and Tutors
Staff acknowledged they would not have been able to offer their courses at the level of quality they 
did during 2020 were it not for the additional support tutorial staff offered to students. At the same 
time,  the  large-scale  use  of  tutors  to  support  undergraduate  teaching  showed  up  some  of  the 
weaknesses in UCT’s management of tutors – most of whom are postgraduate students who also 
struggled with their studies and often living circumstances as well during the pandemic. This brought 
to the fore the need to revise the terms of TA and Tutors training, support, payment and employment 
conditions as well as their integration into the life of academic departments.

Managing the pandemic was a catalyst for creating new services such 
as UCT_Cares, that will remain and become embedded in UCT’s “normal”

2020 TEACHING AND LEARNING REPORT Continued

Re-thinking Support of Students
Apart from UCT’s routine reporting on student academic performance, during 2020, UCT collected 
rich data on the undergraduate student learning experience to inform policy for managing teaching 
and  learning  during  the  first  year  of  the  pandemic.  A  profile  of  the  undergraduate  full-degree 
cohort was built from two student surveys that were carried out in response to ERT and from the 
South  African  Survey  of  Student  Engagement  (SASSE)  of  2018.  The  first  survey  was  run  before 
commencing ERT with a focus on students’ resources and ability to learn remotely. The second one 
was run at the end of the first semester to inform the improvement of online course design for the 
second semester. It was encouraging that most students reported positively about communication 
with course convenors, access to academic support and help with remote assessments. Students 
reported difficulties during ERT revolved around four main issues:
 » Academic factors – lack of communication or support, feeling isolated/disconnected especially 

 » Learning environment – noise and distractions, domestic responsibilities, limited work space and 

from other students.

family conflicts.

 » Personal factors – mental health (e.g. stress and anxiety), lack of motivation/discipline to study.
 » Connectivity factors – lack of internet/power supply/data.
The  pandemic  imposed  a  shutdown  of  what  had  been  “normal”  space-time  on  campus.  In  losing 
campus  space-time,  students  lost  the  timetable  with  its  imposed  discipline.  This  freedom  to 
self-manage worked differently for different groups of students. By the end of 2020, it was clear 
that the best way of supporting many students during the pandemic was to reopen residences and 
create spaces on campus for students to study. The Vulnerable Students Working Group of TOTT 
developed an indicator for identifying the most “vulnerable” students. Using this information, the DSA 
made offers for a place in residence to individual students – although the high demand could not be 
met.

Staff
Feedback  from  staff  was  gathered  from  members  of  the  Academic  Union  (July  2020)  from  a 
teaching staff survey (September 2020), and from reflections by Deputy Deans (September 2021). 
Key findings were as follows:
 » Staff spent much of their time providing support and care to their students.
 » They also had to devote a lot of time to a rapid upskilling in new teaching technologies.
 » They had to reduce course content to accommodate the reduction in students’ weekly workload 

 » Many staff battled to manage their work-life balance, especially those caring for dependents at 

home – the collapse of the work/home space was a source of added stress.

 » These additional demands from work and home had deleterious effects on health, motivation and 

to a notional 30 hours.

research output.

In response, staff requested that going forward UCT’s institutional culture will place greater value on 
teaching expertise and effort.

The UCT Teaching and Learning Conference
This Conference was offered online for the first time in 2020, with the theme of “Shifting Academic 
Identities”.  It  was  oriented  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  staff  to  reflect,  share  and  engage  with 
the challenges and opportunities for teaching remotely and how their sense of professional identity 
shifted during ERT conditions.

Distinguished Teacher Awards
Dr Bodhisattva Kar in Historical Studies and Dr Marlon Swai in Social Anthropology were the recipients 
of the 2020 Vice-Chancellors’ Distinguished Teacher Awards.

CONCLUSION
What UCT had to do under pandemic conditions is far removed from both a sound pedagogy of 
digitally enabled education and the traditional UCT face-to-face approach to teaching. The university 
learnt during 2020 that contact between academics and students in a common space-time cannot 
be  fully  replicated  by  online  teaching.  It  was  also  realised  that  students  need  each  other  to  learn 
and that online spaces, under South African conditions, will deliver neither the learning outcomes 
nor the educational experiences beyond the classroom that make UCT’s graduates internationally 
sought-after. It is hoped that what the university has learnt during this period can translate into deep 
reflection on how it is assumed that students learn; traditional modes of delivery; the nature of the 
spaces in which teaching takes place; the use of technology in the classroom; the content, structure 
and  sequencing  of  the  university’s  curricula  and  assessment  practices.  UCT  remains  a  contact 
residential university. Its status as the top university in Africa and among the best globally, places the 
institution in a good position to lead the development of an innovative synthesis of online and contact 
education and a framework for digitally enabled education that will shape teaching and learning for 
the 21st century in Southern contexts.

OVERVIEW OF THE UCT INSTITUTIONAL FORUM 2021: 
CONSIDERATIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FORUM

INTRODUCTION
As outlined in the Higher Education Act, Act No. 101.1997 S31 (ss 1) the Institutional Forum (IF) 
is mandated by the Higher Education Act of 1997 S31 (1) to advise Council on issues affecting the 
institution, including:
a.  The implementation of this Act and the national policy on higher education;
b.  Race and gender equity policies;
c.  The selection of candidates for senior management positions;
d.  Codes of conduct; mediation and dispute procedures; 
e.  The fostering of an institutional culture which promotes tolerance and respect for fundamental 

human rights and creates an appropriate environment for teaching, research and learning; and

f.  Perform such functions as determined by the council.
The  Institutional  Forum  is  an  active,  critical  committee  that  engages  robustly  on  issues  of 
transformation,  inclusion,  diversity  and  equity.  The  IF  is  the  only  representative  committee  in  the 
university – as it includes representation from all staff and student groups at UCT.

Governance
Governance considerations by IF members this year focused on the Institutional Forum’s Monitoring 
and Evaluation Role of transformation policies and practices. This focus resulted in the Institutional 
Forum Lekgotla which resulted in the establishment of a Monitoring sub-committee that will meet to 
review policies at UCT and report to the IF every six months.

Structure
The Institutional Forum oversees the work of the Transformation Forum and the Employment Equity 
Committee. These two groups focus on different aspects. The Transformation Forum focuses on 
inclusion and diversity whilst the Employment Equity committee focuses on barriers and advancement 
in relation to equity targets. The historic division of these groups was based on a review which found 
that equity discussions dominated meeting times which impacted severely on the actions for cultural 
change and inclusion.
To date the Transformation Forum and the Employment Equity Committee are represented on the 
Institutional Forum where feedback is provided on the work conducted by these two groups.

The Institutional Forum is an active, critical committee that engages 
robustly on issues of transformation, inclusion, diversity and equity.

Employment Equity Plan
The  IF  requested  quarterly  feedback  from  all  units  involved  with  Transformation  on  campus.  The 
Office for Inclusivity & Change (OIC) comprising of Disability Services and Employment Equity, within 
the Office for the Deputy Vice Chancellor for Transformation, provides this quarterly feedback to 
IF on matters related to inclusion, equity and disability. In addition, both the Transformation Forum 
and  the  Employment  Equity  Forum  reports  to  IF.  Documentation  was  provided  from  the  OIC  at 
each meeting of the IF. Under the leadership of the Acting DVC for Transformation Professor Martin 
Hall  who  conceptualised  the  Employment  Equity  Guidance  Note  and  developed  the  University 
Employment Equity Training modules, the following employment equity outcomes were achieved in 
2021.
The University’s new Employment Equity Plan came into effect on 1 January 2022 and steers the 
University’s  implementation  of  Employment  Equity  until  31  December  2026.  The  accompanying 
Employment Equity Guidance Note was developed by Professor Hall and superseded the previous 
University  Practice  Note  that  applied  under  the  previous  Employment  Equity  Plan.  The  Guidance 
Note is a living document which requires updating from time to time on the basis of the experience 
of practitioners across the university, changes in legislation, and new regulations and codes of good 
practice issued by the Department of Employment and Labour. The approach that will be taken to 
the implementation of the university’s current Employment Equity Plan will require amendments to a 
number of current policies and documents.
The  principal  differences  between  the  new  Employment  Equity  plan  and  guidance  and  previous 
practice are as follows:
 » Numerical annual targets and five-year goals have been determined by an evidence-based model 
and agreed following extensive consultation with the Faculties and PASS departments concerned. 
As  required  by  law,  T1  and  T2  temporary  contracts  longer  than  three  months  have  now  been 
included in the university’s Employment Equity Plan.

 » For  the  implementation  of  the  2022-2026  plan,  the  university  has  been  divided  into  14  “units” 
(Faculties,  larger  PASS  Departments  and  clusters  of  smaller  PASS  departments).  Each  unit  is 
responsible for achieving annual targets and overall numerical goals for their unit, in terms of the 
numerical targets set, and agreed, for their unit.

 » Following the requirements of the UCT Employment Equity Policy, on the principles and practice 
of employment equity. This training requirements will be phased in through 2022. The required 
course,  “Fundamentals  of  Employment  Equity”,  will  be  self-paced  and  will  be  delivered  via  the 
HR Success Factors self-service platform.

 » Each  of  the  14  administrative  units  will  have  an  Employment  Equity  Committee  made  up  of 

representative Employment Equity Representatives from the unit.

The  IF  at  UCT  in  2021  continued  to  fulfil  an  important  role  with  respect  to  its  mandate  in  terms 
of  governance  of  transformation  by  working  closely  with  the  transformation  structures. 
Its sub-committees (The Transformation Forum and Employment Equity Forum) remain active and 
robust spaces that drive and operationalise the overall transformation agenda in collaboration with 
the OIC and Transformation Committees.

OVERVIEW OF THE UCT INSTITUTIONAL FORUM 2021: 
CONSIDERATIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FORUM Continued

Employment Equity Plan Continued
 » Each Employment Equity Committee will be responsible for developing and implementing an annual 
project plan for recruiting and appointing suitably qualified candidates to known and anticipated 
vacancies in the unit, and for meeting the agreed annual targets for their unit. For each post, the 
Employment Equity Committee will decide which of two mandates should be used by the selection 
committee, and this mandate becomes the terms of reference for the selection committee. Each 
Employment Equity Committee will be represented on the Employment Equity Forum, which will 
monitor achievement against targets and goals across the university as a whole, reporting to the 
Executive and to the University Human Resources Committee, and recommending adjustments to 
targets and goals if these are required.

 » Deans,  Executive  Directors  and  Directors  will  be  accountable  for  the  achievement  of  numerical 
targets and goals in their units through a KPA for employment equity. Progress in achieving targets 
and goals in their units will be reviewed as part of the annual Development Dialogue process.

 » Maintaining  the  confidentiality  of  selection  committees  is  a  requirement  both  in  terms  of  the 
university’s  regulations,  and  in  terms  of  the  Protection  of  Personal  Information  Act  (POPIA). 
Confidentiality  will  be  enhanced  by  requiring  all  members  of  selection  committees  to  sign  a 
non-disclosure agreement, to be introduced by HR in 2022.

Transformation Forum
During the period of 2021, the Transformation Forum has continued to implement and measure inclusion 
activities within their respective areas. The Transformation Forum also initiated a separate working 
group with the Acting DVC to expedite barriers and challenges experienced within transformation 
committees and within the institution. In addition, the Transformation Forum Community of Practice 
surfaced  concerns  that  transformation  committees  face  as  they  implement  their  inclusion  actions. 
These concerns (mostly process questions) were rapidly responded to and resolved during 2021.

Monitoring and Evaluation
The IF is in particular focused on matters related to the UCT Transformation benchmarks; the Racism 
and Sexual Violence Report, employment equity and transformation seminars nationally and internally, 
and  continued  to  review  the  appointment  of  senior  management  positions  in  the  university.  The 
university  transformation  benchmarks  have  been  used  for  just  over  three  years  to  track  progress 
in  relation  to  student  and  staff  access,  support  and  advancement.  In  addition,  the  benchmarks 
monitor cultural change initiatives, inclusion initiatives and equity approaches that are implemented by 
Transformation Committees in the University. The Transformation Report provides a holistic overview 
of transformation actions in the university during the 2021 period. The role of IF in monitoring and 
evaluation is a substantive function that seeks to ensure that transformation is evidenced in teaching, 
learning, research and the university operations.

UNIVERSITY AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE

The University Audit and Risk Committee (UARC) is a standing committee of Council, which in 
terms of its constitution includes at least five members appointed by Council, who are neither 
staff nor students, and of whom at least two should be external members of Council. The UARC 
is chaired by an external member of Council and as such has direct access to all Council matters.

As  part  of  the  continual  Committee  assessment  against  its  Terms  of  Reference  (ToRs)  and  with 
specific  focus  on  having  the  required  balance  of  skills  and  expertise  required  to  fully  meet  the 
mandate of the Committee, a recommendation was made to have an additional member added to 
Committee. The additional member would be one with expertise in the IT field and this was noted 
as necessary given the general prevalence of the IT risk governance and IT security having become 
an  increasing  area  of  concern  and  effort  for  organisations.  The  University  Council  approved  the 
recommendation in December 2021, with Council member, Kholiwe Makhohliso being appointed a 
new member of the UARC from 1 January 2022.
The key responsibilities of the UARC are listed in Council’s report on corporate governance (page 5) 
of this report.
Attendance at UARC meetings during 2021 is presented in the table below:

INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION, OPERATIONAL 
STRUCTURES AND CONTROLS
The Council through the UARC provides oversight of the preparation, integrity and fair presentation, by 
management, of the Annual Financial Statements and of the financial reporting process. Key functions 
and responsibilities of Council include management of risk and continuous implementation of effective 
and  efficient  internal  control  systems  and  processes.  The  University  maintains  systems  of  internal 
control to mitigate identified risks, to ensure the integrity of the University’s core activities of teaching, 
learning  and  research  including  safeguarding  of  its  assets.  The  University  has  an  organisational 
structure and division of responsibilities, together with established policies and procedures that are 
communicated throughout the institution. Organisational structures are not static and are continually 
under review by management.
Information systems utilising modern information technology are deployed throughout the University. 
These  have  been  developed  and  implemented  according  to  defined  and  documented  standards 
to  achieve  efficiency,  effectiveness,  reliability  and  security.  There  were  no  major  changes  to  the 
University’s key systems during 2021. However, sub-systems were added to adapt to cyber security 
challenges as well as adaptation to more digital operations.
The  University  applies  acceptable  standards  to  protect  privacy  and  ensure  control  over  all  data, 
including  disaster  recovery  and  back-up  procedures,  while  at  the  same  time  complying  with  the 
intention of the Promotion of Access to Information Act to make available information and data that 
should be in the public domain, as befits a public institution.
A  system  of  internal  controls  is  in  place  at  UCT  and  operating  effectively,  however,  there  are 
inherent limitations to the effectiveness and adequacy of any system of internal control, including the 
possibility of human error, (heavy reliance on manual procedures), lack of segregation of duties and 
the circumventing or overriding of controls. UCT can reduce the instance of management override 
by building a culture that promotes honesty and supports a “speak up” culture when things go wrong. 
Furthermore,  maintaining  an  effective  system  of  internal  controls,  can  further  be  supported  by 
having robust Policies and Procedures that support key processes throughout UCT. Accordingly, an 
effective system of internal control can provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation 
of the Annual Financial Statements and safeguarding of assets.
The  University’s  independent  external  auditors,  PricewaterhouseCoopers  (PwC),  assess  key 
accounting systems and financial reporting control system for the purpose of reliance on these 
controls. PwC has performed a combination of substantive audit testing as well as controls reliance 
in the year 2021. Based on the firm’s assessment of identified risks and their understanding of the 
University’s business processes and relevant control activities, this gave comfort for reliance on 
general controls.
The Internal Audit division which functionally reports to the UARC and administratively reports to the 
Vice Chancellor, assesses and monitors internal operational control systems for adequacy and reports 
to the UARC all deficiencies, improvement and effectiveness of controls.

University of Cape Town Annual Report 2021 53

AREAS OF FOCUS OF THE UNIVERSITY AUDIT 
AND RISK COMMITTEE
The UARC is required by Council to ensure that management has adequate controls in place over 
assets, risk and financial systems, and has systems to allow for timeous and accurate financial reporting 
that complies with all applicable requirements. Therefore, UARC plays a key role in the assurance 
process and effectiveness of risk management processes at the University. The UARC’s roles and 
responsibilities are guided by its Terms of Reference (ToRs).
Below are some of the 2021 key areas of focus of the UARC:

IMPROVING THE INTERNAL CONTROLS RELATING TO, 
AND THE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASING CARDS (PCARDS)
The PCard is a Visa credit card issued by Nedbank to authorised staff members and is a convenient 
and  cost-effective  alternative  purchasing  tool  to  replace  low-value,  high-volume  purchase  orders 
that  are  administratively  expensive  (e.g.,  office  consumables)  and  provide  a  purchasing  tool  for 
those  purchases  that  normally  result  in  reimbursements  (e.g.,  internet  payments,  subscriptions, 
and conference fees).
Management commissioned an external party to review a selected number of PCards in 2019. The 
purpose of the review was to provide management with the assurance that spending was aligned 
with various policies related to PCards. The outcome of the review showed that several PCard users 
were not fully adhering to PCard policies. It was, however, noted that most of the transgressions did 
not constitute fraud, misconduct, or misappropriation of resources, but in general reported procedural 
and threshold transgressions, which are relatively straightforward to remedy. These included, among 
others, expense reports not prepared by card processors or signed by the line managers responsible. 
The  most  appropriate  intervention  in  many  instances  requires  greater  awareness  and  formal 
reprimands about adherence to the PCard policies, and where this does not change compliance with 
policies, cards will be suspended. Improving internal communication and a greater commitment to 
policy adherence were the recommended courses of action, and these are being remedied through 
a  number  of  complementary  interventions.  However,  where  there  were  serious  transgressions, 
disciplinary action was initiated as part of consequence management, and two staff members were 
appropriately sanctioned.

As part of improving internal controls, management has introduced several additional improvements 
all  aimed  at  making  compliance  and  accountability  easier.  These  improvements  include  a  training 
plan that would be rolled out using the Success Factors system, implementation of a PCard practice 
note, as well as use of Perceptive Content which would facilitate and enable a user-friendly way of 
processing PCard transactions. Moreover, there are targeted regular messages and training for all key 
individuals involved in the management of PCards. Weekly Business Objects (BOBJ) reports detailing 
unposted  transactions  continue  to  be  emailed  to  PCard  holders  for  follow-up,  and  PCards  with 
unposted transactions more than two months old are blocked automatically. Given the importance 
of the PCard to University operations, there has been a concerted effort and focus by management, 
overseen  by  the  UARC,  supported  by  the  work  of  Internal  Audit,  to  ensure  that  PCard  internal 
controls are enhanced and operate as intended. Management and the committee will continue to 
monitor the effectiveness of internal controls in this area, with audits being performed as appropriate.

IMPROVING THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT WITHIN 
THE POSTGRADUATE FUNDING OFFICE
The  Postgraduate  Funding  Office  (PGFO)  handles  and  processes  refunds  to  students  with  credit 
balances. The Internal Audit department had in prior years raised several issues around the manual 
nature  of  the  process,  which  increased  the  inherent  risk  of  human  error.  Several  cases  of  errors 
relating  to  incorrect  payments  had  been  identified  and  as  a  result,  the  Audit  &  Risk  Committee, 
on recommendation from the Internal Audit, had in 2021 requested that the PGFO refund process 
be  added  onto  the  Internal  Audit  plan  as  an  additional  audit.  The  objective  of  the  audit  was  to 
evaluate  the  design  and  adequacy  of  controls  of  the  process.  Given  the  manual  process  and  the 
limited monitoring and oversight of controls in place, this increased the risk of errors, and the overall 
report rating was noted as weak.
As  part  of  improving  the  control  environment,  management  had  committed  to  implement  a  new 
Pay work package as part of the PGFO PeopleSoft enhancement project which will systematically 
calculate all amounts for refunds with limited human intervention required and will manage the risks 
within the refunds process more effectively. Other controls geared at improving the controls included 
the development of a Refunds Policy, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) documents as well as the 
alignment of SOPs to job descriptions; addressing the staff capacity constraints in order to promote 
segregation of duties, monitoring and oversight controls.
The Committee had regular updates from the PGFO and Internal Audit department throughout the 
year and continues to monitor the effects of the implemented recommendations within the PGFO 
department.

ANNUAL REPORT INCLUDING ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Annual Report is prepared to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Higher Education 
Act.  Management  prepares  and  validates  the  report,  ensuring  that  it  provides  a  balanced  and 
reasonable  view  of  the  university,  its  performance  for  the  year  and  outlook.  Responsibility  for 
producing  the  report  is  assigned  to  the  Executive  management  and  senior  management  of  the 
university, with oversight of the VC. The report is noted by the UARC to ensure management and 
University  Finance  Committee  (UFC)  have  carried  out  their  roles  and  responsibilities.  Financial 
information includes the audited consolidated annual financial statements. The external auditors, PwC, 
review the information in the Annual Report to ensure that there is no material inconsistency to their 
knowledge and information contained in the audited consolidated annual financial statements. The 
Annual Report is approved by Council after the recommendation by management, UFC and UARC.
The committee continues to focus on the preparation and audit of the Consolidated Annual Financial 
Statements, and the focus for the 2021 financial year related to the following:

The Impact of COVID-19
The  continued  nationwide  lockdown  resulted  in  ongoing  adjustments  having  to  be  made  on  how 
the audit was conducted and how audit evidence could be provided to the auditors. Given almost 
two years of remote working and conducting an external audit, the onboarding of PwC as the new 
external auditors was managed with relative ease.

Student Fee Debt
The continuing COVID-19 effects, challenging economic environment and the announcement by the 
University to remove the fee block to enable students with outstanding fees to register for 2021 
academic year we have noticed increase in student fee debt. As a result, attention has been placed 
on the adequacy and accuracy of the Student Fee Debt provision.

Auditor General Requirements
The Auditor General mandates that the external auditors perform certain additional procedures as 
detailed below:
 » Compliance with the Higher Education Act, No 101 of 1997 (as amended)
 » Understanding the Procurement and contract management processes
 » The audit of predetermined objectives in terms International Standards on Assurance Engagement 

3000

 » Conflict of interest declarations

INTERNAL AUDIT AND THE INTERNAL AUDIT PLAN
The objective of the Office of Internal Audit is to evaluate and recommend improvements to the 
University’s internal control structure, prioritising its efforts by continuously facilitating an objective 
risk assessment.
The Office of Internal Audit performs many valuable functions including Assurance Audits, Factual 
Findings and Agreed Upon Procedure Audits. The results thereof are reported to the appropriate 
stakeholders, including University Executive Management, Management and the UARC. The results 
of Factual Finding and Agreed Upon Procedures are also shared with external stakeholders.
The Office of Internal Audit is governed by the adherence to their Code of Ethics and The Institute 
of  Internal  Auditors’  International  Standards  for  the  Professional  Practice  of  Internal  Auditing. 
This mandatory guidance constitutes principles of the fundamental requirements for the professional 
practice  of  internal  auditing  and  for  evaluating  effectiveness  of  the  internal  audit’s  performance. 
In addition, the Office of Internal Audit adheres to relevant University Policies and procedures.
The Head of Internal Audit reports functionally to the UARC, administratively to the Vice Chancellor 
and  has  access  to  the  Chair  of  the  UARC.  Internal  Audit  remains  functionally  independent  of  the 
activities and the day-to-day internal control processes that they audit.
The  UARC  is  responsible  for  approving  the  Audit  Plan,  the  Internal  Audit  Charter  and  provides 
oversight over the Internal Audit function. Internal audit can carry out and conduct their audits, free 
of influence by any element in the University, including matters of audit selection, scope, procedures, 
frequency of audits, timing, and report content to maintain independence and objectivity. Internal 
Audit continues to deliver on the agreed Audit Plan and meet with stakeholders to understand their 
key risks and adapt the audit plan accordingly. The internal audit annual plan considers the key risks 
identified  by  management,  the  requirements  of  the  UARC  and  management,  as  well  as  available 
resources.
Regular  audit  reports  are  presented  at  the  UARC  for  consideration.  The  results  of  the  audits  are 
used as a basis to work with management and jointly provide recommendations and suggestions to 
improvements in systems and processes, including governance.
Based on the results of the planned audits and ad hoc reviews undertaken during 2021, it is concluded 
that the key internal financial controls were effective in all material aspects and reported findings did 
not expose the University to significant risks.

The Office of Internal Audit performs many valuable functions including 
Assurance Audits, Factual Findings and Agreed Upon Procedure Audits.

AREAS OF FOCUS OF THE UNIVERSITY AUDIT 
AND RISK COMMITTEE Continued

GOING CONCERN AND FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY
The  University  maintains  a  delicate  balance  between  income  received  from  government,  student 
fees, and third-stream funding against the expenditure priorities. The biggest spend is on personnel 
expenditure,  followed  by  other  activities  related  to  the  University’s  overall  objective  of  teaching, 
learning and research. The decrease in government subsidies over recent few years only magnifies 
the challenges brought about due to the chronic underfunding from government over the past two 
decades.
The  University  Finance  Committee  (UFC)  plays  an  important  role  in  oversight  of  the  continued 
financial sustainability of the University. One of the areas reviewed by the UFC in terms of financial 
sustainability,  is  the  support  the  University  provides  to  financially  needy  and  academically  eligible 
students. The review showed the important role that the University plays in the funding of students, 
and highlighted areas of concern given that the level of government funding is not sustainable over 
the medium- to long-term given the economic challenges faced by the country.
The UARC, having considered the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements, has not identified any 
issues to indicate that the going concern assumptions applied by management were inappropriate. 
The Committee has taken note of and reviewed the disclosures in respect of the continued impact 
of COVID-19, student fee debt challenges for the sector as well as the outlook for state funding and 
NSFAS.
Given the insights and details provided by management, the UARC is thus supportive of the going 
concern assumption being appropriate.

ROTATION OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The University’s policy is that external auditors will be appointed for a period of five years, subject 
to  the  annual  recommendation  from  the  UARC  to  the  University  Council  for  approval,  as  well  as 
concurrence  from  the  Auditor  General  South  Africa  (AGSA).  The  University  can  terminate  the 
appointment at any time during the five-year period.
Under the provisions of the Public Audit Act, the appointment of auditors is to be made in consultation 
with the AGSA.
During  August  of  2020,  a  tender  process  for  the  appointment  of  new  external  auditors  for  the 
2021 financial year commenced. The University ran an open tender, and the process was facilitated 
by  the  University’s  Procurement  and  Payment  Services  department.  A  briefing  session  was  held 
with  interested  audit  firms.  Seven  firms  had  fully  compliant  tender  submissions  and  three  firms 
were  shortlisted.  Interviews  took  place  during  October  2020  and  PwC  was  awarded  the  tender. 
The appointment of PwC, as of 1 January 2021, is as per the University policy and was endorsed by 
Council and ratified by the AGSA.
UARC  meetings  are  attended  by  the  AGSA  representative  and  where  appropriate  guidance  is 
provided on aspects relating to the public audit prescripts.

INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL AUDITS
The UARC reviewed the audit approach and key risk areas of the external audit. During the year under 
review, the UARC has interacted with Internal Audit in respect of the internal audit plan and continues 
to review progress against the plan and the findings from the respective audits. UARC is satisfied that 
the auditors have communicated according to their mandate in 2021.

RISK MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
UCT is committed to establishing and maintaining a systematic approach to the proactive identification, 
assessment, and management of risks, but also take advantage of the opportunities that risks may 
present. As a result, the University Council has several governance committees to assist Council in 
discharging  its  risk  management  responsibility.  The  University  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  (UARC) 
provides  an  important  and  direct  link  to  Council  on  all  matters  relating  to  risk  and  is  chaired  by  a 
member  of  Council.  In  addition,  to  the  UARC,  the  University  has  a  Risk  Management  Executive 
Committee (RMEC) that is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor. Memberships of the RMEC comprises of 
the Chief Operating Officer (COO) who is the Deputy Chairperson of the committee, the Registrar, 
all Deputy Vice-Chancellors, two Deans representatives, an Executive Director, and the Director of 
Institutional Planning. The RMEC also has several senior managers including the Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO),  Executive  Directors,  and  Head  of  Internal  Audit  as  Assessor  members.  Senior  managers 
responsible for various portfolios are permanent attendees of RMEC and provide reports covering 
several key operational areas/activities.
Over the last two years, the committee has reviewed and updated its terms of reference to ensure 
adequate representation on the committee and align its objectives to address the risk and threats 
faced by the University. The committee meets at least four times annually and has robust discussions 
on key risks and other related matters affecting the University. Special meetings are also arranged 
as and when necessary. Following each RMEC meeting, the Vice-Chancellor and the COO prepare a 
detailed Risk Management report which is presented to the UARC. In between the RMEC meetings, 
there are numerous formal and informal engagements with the Chair of the UARC and other members 
as and when necessary on key matters relating to risk management.

RISK MANAGEMENT AREAS OF FOCUS
As risk is inherent in all the operations of the University, the Executive and Management are responsible 
for the daily activities and ongoing management of risks facing the University. The University has 
various committees, working groups/forums and task teams dealing with various teaching, learning, 
research, and operational risks.

DEALING WITH STRATEGIC, OPERATIONAL, 
AND EMERGING RISKS
At the beginning of 2021, the Chair of Council, selected members of Council (including the UARC), 
members of the University Executive, Head of Internal Audit, members of the Risk Office, and other 
senior members had a facilitated risk workshop to identify and assess the impact of risks which are 
likely to negatively impact the University from attaining its objectives. This workshop was important 
as it confirmed that the risk approach adopted by the University is aligned to University strategy 
and  risk  appetite.  In  addition,  the  workshops  showed  a  strong  interaction  between  the  top  risks 
as  indicated  by  the  Institute  of  Risk  Management  of  South  Africa  (IRMSA)  and  what  UCT’s  top 
risks are emerging to be. In addition to the strategic risk register, all the University faculties and key 
departments  have  their  own  operational  risk  registers  which  are  assessed  and  updated  regularly. 
Those registers are presented by the accountable persons to the RMEC to keep them abreast of the 
operational and emerging risks. Emerging risks are also identified, assessed and mitigation measure 
provided on how to manage those risks.

DEALING WITH DISRUPTIVE RISK EVENTS
UCT  has  continuously  enhanced  systems  and  processes  over  the  last  few  years  to  mitigate  and 
manage any potential disruptions/threats to its operations. Two of the major events which impacted 
in the University included the ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the UCT fire incident that took place 
on the 18 April 2021.

COVID-19 Pandemic
To respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic challenges, the University leadership established 
the COVID Coordinating Committee (CCC) – which is responsible for responding to the outbreak. The 
committee is chaired by COO, Dr Reno Morar and it is tasked with continued close monitoring of any 
developments around COVID-19-related matters and is working in partnership with the Department 
of Health, the NICD, the Western Cape Department of Health, and other spheres and agencies of 
government. The CCC met regularly to advise the Vice-Chancellor and the Executive on how to 
effectively deal with the pandemic whilst maintaining key operations in teaching and learning, and 
research. UCT in partnership with the Provincial Department of Health established a UCT Community 
of  Hope  Vaccination  Centre.  This  Centre  was  open  to  all  members  of  the  public,  with  staff  and 
students being encouraged to make full use of the site. 
Managing COVID-19 on Campus is integrated into the OHSE programme and the roles, responsibilities 
and  accountabilities  have  been  defined  within  a  new  legal  OHS  structure  to  facilitate  a  pragmatic 
approach  OHSE.  A  central  OHSE  advisory  committee  was  established  to  foster  participation 
across  UCT  with  representatives  from  each  Department  or  Faculty,  reporting  to  the  Executive. 
Key performance outcome areas have been defined and feedback on prioritised areas have been 
regularly communicated to the Executive through the Committee. Whilst UCT’s commitment as per 
the  OHSE  policy  is  to  mitigate  all  possible  risks  of  harm  to  UCT  staff,  students,  contractors  and 
visitors, a more robust risk and incident management system has been developed to ensure that all 
incidents be investigated with appropriate corrective actions and timeous close-out.

UCT Fire
The UCT fire can be regarded as a black swan event due to the nature of the incident, and the impact 
it had on operations. The University managed to successfully evacuate approximately 4 000 students 
and staff members in residences. This was executed in a safe manner without any major security or 
health incident during level three lockdown. All students and staff affected were accommodated in 
hotels on the same day with the University carrying the costs. Students and staff were provided with 
meals and warm clothing as required. Students and staff in residents who suffered loss of items due 
to them being damaged or lost were reimbursed by the University insurers.
In dealing with the UCT fire, the University Executive established a (UCT) Fire Operations Committee 
that met weekly, and a Steering Committee made up of senior managers which met monthly. The 
Operations Committee provided ongoing progress updates on matters relating to capital planning, 
health and safety, risk and insurance, finance, legal issues, communication, environment sustainability, 
information  and  technology  services,  student  affairs,  biological  sciences,  libraries,  and  human 
resources.  The  Steering  Committee  reported  to  the  Vice-Chancellor  on  all  critical  matters  and 
milestones achieved. The work of these two committees was instrumental in returning UCT to its 

core business without any prolonged impact on its operation. In addition, the relocation of staff that 
were housed in affected buildings were major impediments following the fire. Most of the materials 
from  the  Jagger  basements  had  been  salvaged  and  a  two-  to  three-year  recovery  process  was 
envisaged. A two-year lease had been signed for temporary premises close to the University. An 
extensive collaborative network had been created with national and international universities to assist 
with  the  collection  of  library  material  that  was  lost  to  the  fire  or  damaged  during  the  incident.  A 
major risk highlighted by the fire was the lack of conservation expertise, skills, and infrastructure both 
nationally and internationally. Furthermore, the long-term preservation of materials is major concern 
that will take time to complete. Capacity building is crucial in mitigating this risk and the University 
commenced with the process of appointing an experienced Conservator.

Disaster Management Plans
One  area  of  performance  that  OHSE  had  honed  into  in  2021  was  the  emergency  and  disaster 
management preparedness and response as a result of the devastating wildfire in April 2021. Properties 
and  Services  embarked  on  the  upgrading  of  the  fire  management  systems  with  sophisticated 
technology that will enhance fire detection. The newly built Joint Operating Centre enables a more 
efficient, technology-driven monitoring and rapid response to emergencies. First responders during 
an emergency have received tailored training creating a more agile response to typical emergencies 
and disaster scenarios. Student residences continue with the rigorous evacuation drills of twice per 
annum and plans for campus wide drills are underway and will be coordinated between the OHSE 
Division and Campus Risk services. A revised OHSE programme was established in 2021 to enable 
the delivery of the OHSE strategic framework and plan over the next three to five years to meet full 
OHSE compliance as well as international best practices. A systematic and risk-based approach was 
adopted and most of the planning phase had taken place during 2021, the University was ready to 
ramp up on its implementation phase to meet desired objective and targets.

Business Continuity Management
UCT  has  first-hand  experience  over  the  last  several  years  in  responding  to  crises  and  disruptive 
events  that  threatened  the  ability  to  successfully  continue  with  teaching,  learning,  and  research 
activities.  The  UCT  Internal  Audit  in  2019  made  a  finding  indicating  that  UCT  needed  a  formal 
business continuity management plan. The realisation that UCT does not have the internal capability 
to undertake the task without external assistance resulted in the development of a formal business 
continuity management plan tender planned for 2022 with the appointment of a capable external 
service provider.
Although  UCT  has  been  able  to  successfully  respond  to  disruptions  in  the  past,  the  University 
appreciates  the  benefits  of  having  a  robust  business  continuity  capability,  including  risk-based 
plans,  a  supporting  framework,  and  policy  to  allow  for  quick  recovery  from  an  event  to  continue 
its key operations. To ensure that its plans and operations remain robust and resilient in dealing with 
disruptions, the University is in a process to appoint a service provider to assist with the development 
of a formal Business Continuity Plan (BCP). The request for proposal of appointment of a service 
provider is planned for 2022 and is on track.

Insurance Risk
UCT is part of Tertiary Risk Insurance South Africa (TERISA), which is made up of all public universities. 
TERISA is managed by Marsh Africa (Insurance Brokers) to cater for the insurance needs of Higher 
Education  institutions.  The  UCT  claim  relating  to  the  fire  is  ongoing  and  given  the  loss  of  unique 
and rare information material, the library claim will be ongoing for several years. The smaller part of 
the loss has already been covered by the Insurers including student and staff personal belongings 
lost in the fire. To ensure that students were not adversely impacted by the loss of personal items, 
their claims were prioritised, and settlement of all legitimate claims was done within a few months of 
claimant submitting all the necessary and supporting documents for their losses. The insurers have 
made significant interim payment to the University.

Student Funding and Debt Management
One of the significant risks facing all institutions of higher education is the issue of student funding 
and  debt  owed  by  returning  students.  The  National  Student  Financial  Aid  Scheme  (NSFAS)  is  a 
government  entity  responsible  for  undergraduate  student  funding.  At  the  beginning  of  the  2021 
academic year, NSFAS made far reaching policy changes which included that the entity is no longer 
providing  funding  for  postgraduate  courses,  including  postgraduate  diplomas.  Students  who  had 
been previously funded in 2020 were granted continued funding for the completion of their courses. 
However, no new funding was provided for students who had applied for 2021 with the result that 
students  who  had  applied  and  provided  the  necessary  supporting  documents  were  informed  to 
consider other funding opportunities. In addition, NSFAS could not provide confirmation for 2021 first 
time entering students (FTENs) due to the delays in confirming funding outcomes for the 2021 first 
time entering students. Through its own funding, the University supported students who had applied 
for NSFAS funding by providing financial assistance for tuition and accommodation for financially and 
academically  eligible  students.  Council  also  took  an  unprecedented  decision  by  allowing  students 
who had 2020 debt to register in 2021. This far-reaching concession was necessitated following the 
impact of COVID-19 on households and the need to ensure that selected students can continue with 
their studies despite carrying debt from the previous academic year. As part of ensuring its financial 
sustainability,  the  University  Finance  Committee  (UFC)  plays  an  important  role  in  oversight  of  the 
budget and quarterly reports are presented on the financial performance of the University including 
debt collection and management.

Cybercrime and Information Security Breaches
Cybercrime  and  information  threat  of  cybercrime  and  information  security  breaches  remains  an 
ever-present danger for the University. UCT’s Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) 
continuously  works  with  the  communications  department  within  Information  communication  and 
Technology Services (ICTS) to ensure that users remain aware of the current threats facing the UCT 
community. The Security awareness campaign is currently on hold, however, there is a continuous 
effort to keep our staff and students informed. The month of October each year is Security awareness 
month, and the University provides communication and training on various training initiatives aimed at 
raising information security awareness with staff and students. The October security awareness drive 
is a heightened effort to raise awareness, which is augmented by year-round communication on key 
information security topics.
In addition to a detailed cyber security report presented to RMEC and shared with the UARC, there 
are  constant  awareness  and  information  campaigns  aimed  at  staff  and  students.  The  University  is 
aware  that  there  is  a  global  scarcity  of  qualified  and  experienced  information  security  resources. 
Remote working has opened new avenues for staff to seek opportunities locally and internationally. 
This coupled with lucrative offers from corporates and other entities has resulted in UCT losing some 
of its highly valuable and regarded staff members. To protect UCT assets by providing a cohesive 
Information security capability and incident response, UCT not only needs to continuously provide 
opportunities  for  staff  members  to  enhance  their  skills  in  this  field,  but  it  is  also  critical  for  the 
University to retain staff with the requisite skills and competencies.

Preventing and Minimising the Impact of Fraud and Corruption
The University aims to maintain the highest standards of integrity in all its activities and has several 
measures in place to deal with fraud. There are no major incidents of fraud reported over the last 
few  years  which  points  to  robust  internal  controls.  The  process  for  updating  the  UCT  Fraud  and 
Corruption Prevention Policy was initiated and RMEC was satisfied that the draft could be shared 
with key stakeholders for review and comments. The updated policy is anticipated to be presented 
and approved by Council at one of its meetings in 2022. In addition to the review of the Fraud and 
Corruption Prevention Policy a fraud case management reporting tool will be introduced. Any fraud 
or corruption case that is reported will be captured and maintained for data analysis. UCT also has 
an  external  whistle  blowing  hotline  managed  by  a  dedicated  service  provider.  The  hotline  assists 
management in matters which may not have been picked up through internal reporting. To ensure 
accountability, quarterly reports are presented to RMEC with the Registrar also providing an annual 
update to the UCT community.

Through its own funding, the University supported students who had 
applied for NSFAS funding by providing financial assistance for tuition and 
accommodation for financially and academically eligible students.

Measures to Reduce Crime On and Off Campus
The University is dedicated to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all its staff, students, 
visitors, and contractors on all campuses, by putting measures in place to mitigate all the identified 
risks  in  teaching  and  research  environments.  The  Campus  Protection  Services  (CPS)  is  active  in 
providing  guidelines  to  students,  staff  and  third  parties  on  how  to  stay  safe  on  and  off  campus. 
The  University  has  invested  in  increasing  security  visibility  on  major  routes  used  by  students  and 
staff. In addition, there is a close working relationship and collaboration with the South African Police 
Service (SAPS) and the Groote Schuur Community Improvement District (GSCID).

Other Risks
Investment, financial, market and price risks are addressed in the financial report section.

UNIVERSITY FINANCE COMMITTEE
The University Finance Committee (UFC) is a standing committee of Council and is chaired by 
an external member of Council. The committee consists of four members of Council (one of 
whom must be the Chair), the Vice-Chancellor, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial 
Officer, three members nominated by Senate and two members nominated by the Students’ 
Representative Council.
The UFC operates within the planning and strategic frameworks decided by Council and in turn advises 
on financial strategy, makes recommendations on operating and capital budgets, and monitors and 
reports quarterly on progress against these budgets. It does not explicitly recommend the allocation 
of resources but considers the risk of the specific allocations on cash flow and free cash.
The committee met four times during 2021.

UCT pays extensive attention to financial management, seeking to ensure 
a combination of good practice, stewardship and forward projection that 
provides the university with the financial resources needed to meet its 
objectives.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
UCT pays extensive attention to financial management, seeking to ensure a combination of good 
practice, stewardship and forward projection that provides the university with the financial resources 
needed to meet its objectives. The comprehensive university financial plan consists of seven distinct, 
yet interrelated components:
 » Continuing educational operations
 » Research and other operations similarly dependant on specific funding
 » Student housing operations
 » Investment income and financing expenditure
 » Capital expenditure
 » Capital structure and financing
 » Cash flow planning

FINANCIAL POLICY
The Financial Policy of the University seeks to secure the financial sustainability for the University, as 
articulated in the policy wording below:
Our financial policy is to provide for sustainable operations and the ability to invest in educational 
initiatives consistent with our mission. We practise conservative financial management, by striving for 
efficient recurrent operations which generate funds to support strategic initiatives.
UCT plans within a multi-year framework. The financial policy is realised by integrating the following 
areas:
 » We  target  a  surplus  from  Council-controlled  recurrent  operations  to  fund  new  initiatives  and 

provide a hedge against unforeseen circumstances;

 » Capital  expenditure  is  undertaken  in  terms  of  the  strategic  framework  and  is  constrained  by 

affordability as evidenced by available cash resources and borrowing capacity;

 » Debt finance is used conservatively if required and further constrained by the ability to service the 

debt, in terms of both the interest and capital repayments;

 » Investment income after deducting all financing costs, being volatile in nature, is only used to seed 

new initiatives and other strategic choices.

CASH FLOW PLANNING
The cash flow cycle at UCT has a low point at the end of January and peaks in August/September 
after the bulk of fees and most subsidies have been received. Careful planning and management of 
our cash remains crucial in generating investment income and in providing the capacity to undertake 
projects, subject to a revised financial assessment at such time.

University of Cape Town Annual Report 2021 62

www.uct.ac.zaREPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY FINANCE COMMITTEE Continued

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT Continued

SUSTAINABILITY
Our strategic goal of financial sustainability remains a function of recurrent operations and free cash 
reserves. While our operating margins are low, the risk is somewhat mitigated as we know the bulk of 
our income (subsidy and fees) are received early in the operating cycle, and if these are significantly 
different from plan, we would have the opportunity to react and adjust our operations accordingly. 
For the eighth consecutive year our free cash reserves are within the guidelines stipulated in our 
financial policy.
In the preliminary university’s financial sustainability plan, the university has identified projects that 
will enable it to grow its top line focusing on the university’s core business of teaching, learning and 
research. As a result, the university is reviewing its current investments in the third income stream to 
ensure strategic alignment to the university and for the university to be financially sustainable.
The  constrained  fee  increases  remain  a  concern  and  combined  with  the  hangover  effects  of  the 
COVID-19  pandemic  on  fee  payers  and  increasing  pressure  on  the  state  to  continue  meeting  its 
funding  commitments  remain  factors  to  which  we  are  vigilant.  These  events  and  uncertainties 
continue to provide a warning against complacency and emphasise the importance of being within 
our free cash reserve target as well as remaining aware of economic outlooks and challenges faced 
by the state.

fact not generate a surplus given the multi-year nature of research contracts and donations. The 
balance of the result relating to council-controlled activities can be largely attributed to the net 
bottom line cost savings from Council Controlled operations, while the Student Housing operations 
reported a deficit of R60.9 million.

0.6% 

(2020: 8.4% increase), 
the increase in student fee 
receivables of 11.9% being 
the biggest contributor due 
to the uplifting of fee block 
and prudent University 
provision matrix

Most of the non-current assets are designated and Council has no discretion over these. All immovable 
property cannot be alienated without the approval of the Minister of Higher Education and Training. 
This amounts to R4.1 billion, being 26% of total assets for the current fiscal year (2020: R3.7 billion).
Approximately  60%  of  the  investments  are  held  by  the  UCT  Foundation  and  are  designated  for 
specific activities. The balance is held within the University operations, with 80% thereof designated 
for specifically funded restricted activities.
The  increase  in  the  student  fee  receivables  is  characterised  by  the  fact  that  9.4%  of  this  debt  is 
over 12 months overdue. Student fee debt collection remains a key focus by management, more so 
given the effect that COVID-19 may have on the timing and ability to effect collections. In-person 
graduations have long been a strong driver of fee settlements, and the longer-term impacts of online 
graduations remain to be seen.
Capital Expenditure of R436 million was similar in value to the investment in 2020.
The University has a healthy gearing ratio, with liabilities totalling R3.38 billion against total assets of 
R15.63 billion; a debt ratio of 0.22. The University did not increase its long-term borrowings in 2021, 
but continued settling the total drawdown of R110 million from the Development Bank of Southern 
Africa (DBSA) loan facility, which was used to fund the conference centre at the Graduate School of 
Business. This loan is repayable over 10 years and the University is in its fourth year of repayment.

Council Controlled Unrestricted operations encompass the main recurrent operating activities that 
provide and support teaching and learning. Thus, in respect of these operations only, total recurrent 
operating income increased by R368.6 million (10.8%) to R3.79 billion, primarily due to an increase 
in tuition fees of R257.9 million (20.9%), taking the 2021 total to R1.49 billion, and services rendered 
which increased by R83.1 million (59%).
The increase in tuition fee income is primarily due to the increase in our intake of first-time entering 
new students at UCT in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in services rendered relates primarily to 
third  stream  revenue  and  commercial  activities,  being  our  accommodation  related  entities  of  two 
Marriott operated hotel properties, vacation accommodation and the conference centre at the GSB. 
Although these operations were all severely impacted by lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year, the muted increase indicates the slow recovery of 
the  hospitality  market  as  COVID-19  restrictions  were  being  eased,  allowing  for  the  resumption  of 
business and leisure travel and conferencing.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF 
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Continued
Tuition  fees  are  netted  off  against  UCT  council  and  restricted  funding  financial  aid  and  bursaries, 
as is required by IFRS. The tuition income before the IFRS mandated adjustments is R1.64 billion, 
an increase of R184.4 million. At a net level, post the required adjustments, tuition revenues increased 
by R257.9 million or 20.9%. At a more granular level, the increase in tuition fees is attributable to a 
combination  of  increased  volumes  of  first-time  entering  new  students  at  UCT,  increased  fee  rates 
and a greater number of students being NSFAS funded, which results in a decrease in financial aid 
underwriting from university operations in the year.
Expenditure  increased  by  R199.8  million  (5.5%)  to  R3.82  billion,  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in 
personnel costs of R132.7 million (5.2%) and an increase in other operating costs of R159.5 million 
(25.4%).  The  main  driver  of  the  increase  in  personnel  costs  is  the  annual  primarily  due  to  vacant 
permanent posts being filled and the cost-of-living increment agreed with unions.
Our undergraduate students received a total of R1.73 billion in financial support, up from R1.43 billion 
in 2020. This support comes from various sources; corporate and other external bursaries support 
students  to  a  value  of  R293  million,  while  NSFAS  provided  grants  amounting  to  R761  million  and 
UCT a further R548 million from council-controlled funds (of which R52.6 million has been netted off 
against tuition fee income). In addition, income from endowments and other funds available to the 
University for the purposes of financial aid contributed R128.2 million.
As shown in the table on page 65, when excluding the effect of the IFRS15 offsetting of Designated 
bursaries against Council-controlled tuition income, as well as the exclusion of net finance income, 
the council-controlled recurrent operations generated a deficit of R80 million, following the deficit in 
2020 of R209 million. At a high level, this significant decrease in the deficit can almost entirely be 
attributed to the turnaround and recovery from COVID19 as well as the increase in first-time entering 
new students at UCT.
The actual surplus attributable to council-controlled unrestricted funds, as reflected in the Consolidated 
Income Statement on page 101 is R140.5 million, compared to R39.9 million in 2020, with investment 
income  of  R172  million  (R205.6  million  in  2020)  being  the  major  contributor  in  both  years  to  the 
difference between this and the 2020 surplus mentioned above.

Our undergraduate students received a total of R1.73 billion in financial 
support, up from R1.43 billion in 2020.

*  IFRS15:  Revenue  from  Contracts  with  Customers  requires  bursaries  that  offset  tuition  costs  be  offset  against 
tuition income, and not be disclosed as expenses. However, as all tuition income is Council-controlled, the portion 
of Specifically Funded Activities’ bursaries that are offset against tuition income represents a transfer of expenses 
from Specifically Funded Activities to Council. For the analysis of Council performance above, the effect of this 
IFRS15 adjustment has been removed.

Specifically Funded Activities Restricted refers to research and other specifically funded activities 
which  are  usually  outside  the  decision  rights  of  university  management,  while  governance  and 
monitoring rights, and at times approval rights are nevertheless retained. While these activities are of 
important academic and social value, they continue to add to the risks of the university, particularly 
in respect of their restricted decision rights relating to cash flows, accounts receivable management 
and infrastructural support. Increasingly complex compliance and reporting requirements attached to 
research contracts also pose increasing risks and needs for resources to mitigate such risks.
Revenues decreased slightly by 5.15% to R2.74 billion. Government-related grants decreased by 
14.2% from R479.4 million to R411.5 million, while contracts showed an increase of 19% from R1.04 
billion to R1.24 billion. The University has experienced substantial growth in research activity for an 
extended period which continues to place significant demands on core administrative departments, 
which in many cases continue to receive little in the way of real increases in resources to manage 
this growth. As these departments become more over-stretched, the risk of reputational damage 
increases.

As a research-intensive university, obtaining funding to do research remains a strategic imperative. 
Hence the importance of ensuring we have systems and people in place that enable research and 
continue  to  attract  research  funding  in  a  sustainable  manner.  The  University’s  research-related 
activities  income  has  been  on  an  upward  trajectory  for  many  years  now,  breaching  the  R1  billion 
threshold  in  2014.  Research  related  revenue  (grants  and  contract  income)  stands  at  R1.65  billion 
(2020: R1.52 billion) which represents 60% of the total specifically funded activities (R2.74 billion) in 
value. It also continues to account for at least 23% of total university income.
Regarding  the  broad  categories  of  funding,  contract  income  of  R1.24  billion  (2020:  R1.04  billion) 
constitutes 45% of the research revenue, with government grants amounting to R411.5 million (2020: 
R479.4  million)  accounting  for  15%  of  the  research  revenue.  Research  related  donations  totalling 
R394.5 million, showed a significant decrease of R340.4 million when compared to 2020.
The top 10 major funders of research at the university include: the National Research Foundation 
(NRF),  the  Bill  and  Melinda  Gates  Foundation  (BMGF),  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  the 
Medical  Research  Council  (MRC)  and  the  Wellcome  Trust.  The  NRF  remains  the  biggest  source 
of research funding, constituting at least 22% of the total research revenue. It also funds the most 
researchers and their students. Given the NRF is state funded, it too has come under severe funding 
pressure because of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the fiscus.
2021  proved  to  be  a  highly  active  year  for  innovation,  with  ten  transactions  (R18.6m  investment) 
between the University Technology Fund (UTF) and UCT spin-off companies, or projects incubated 
within UCT that will become incorporated companies in the near future. UCT is a Special Partner of 
the UTF and at certain levels of investment the university co-invests using resources from the UCT 
Evergreen Fund.
Three new companies were incorporated or recognised as UCT spin-offs: Quovo (Pty) Ltd; MariHealth 
(Pty) Ltd; and Nautilus Enterprises (Pty) Ltd. The companies represent the commercialisation of a 
diverse range of research outputs, from blockchain applied to privacy and management of data in 
the health and finance sectors, forensics equipment to determine the time of death more accurately, 
through  to  various  interventions  relating  to  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  abalone,  especially  in  the 
earliest stages of their mariculture. This brings the total number of spin-offs since 2004 to 30, and of 
these 27 companies are operational, albeit that in some instances there is limited activity for assorted 
reasons. 14 companies have earned revenue, whilst others are still involved with funded technology 
development,  especially  when  their  products  are  medical  and  related  devices  that  require  clinical 
evaluation and regulatory approval.
Six new projects were awarded funding by the UCT Innovation Builder Fund, and 25 projects are 
currently being managed. 23 licences granted rights to UCT intellectual property, with the AfriTox® 
poisons information database being in the most demand. 34 new invention disclosures were received 
(an increase on 2020, but still short of the pre-COVID levels), 40 new patent applications were filed, 
and 23 patents granted in different countries.
Income from donations and gifts amounted to R394.5 million compared to the R734.9 million raised 
in 2020. Apart from the large single donation from the Atlantic Philanthropies towards the Nelson 
Mandela School of Public Governance building project in 2020, in 2021, donations from the top ten 
donors have remained consistent versus prior years.

maintenance,  and  contribute  towards  the  expansion  of  student  housing  stock,  thereby  providing 
greater access to students.
Total revenues increased significantly by 112.5% to R517.5 million, while the recurrent deficit of R60.9 
million, when added to the provision for loan repayments of R21 million, means the housing sector 
failed to make any noteworthy progress in respect of its debt repayment obligations related to the 
OBZ Square development.
The  primary  driver  underpinning  the  reported  loss  in  operating  our  residences  was  the  COVID-19 
pandemic resulting in the loss of 800 shared bedroom spaces and COVID compliancy related costs 
in catering operations.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
The operations yielded a net inflow of R251.4 million (2020: 713.3 million) for the year. The variance 
in comparison to prior year is a decrease of 65%. The main contributing factors are:
 » An increase in personnel costs of R217.6 million which is attributed to the annual increment and 

filling up of vacant positions.

 » A decrease in the change in trade payables of R400.8 million mostly attributable to the significant 
increase in student deposits in 2020 versus the subsequent decrease in 2021 of the same, as no 
refunds for residences were processed in 2021.

 » An increase in other operating expenses of R315.3 million mainly due to additional costs in rentals 

and catering including a spike in repairs and maintenance.

FUTURE CHALLENGES – 2022 AND BEYOND
In prior years, we indicated that the outlook for the economy in general remained bleak. Prior to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, this was still the view. The pandemic has simply served to pile additional 
pressure  on  an  economy  that  was  already  struggling.  With  the  confirmed  real  decreases  in  state 
funding  commitments  for  UCT  in  2021  we  remain  concerned  at  how  sustainable  this  funding  will 
be given the significant challenges faced by government, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 
pandemic and overall state funding constraints.
It is also well understood that inflation in the higher education (HE) sector (illustrated by the Higher 
Education Price Index (HEPI) and our own Internal Inflation) continues to be higher than the official 
consumer price index (CPI). Thus, by way of example, if the Department of Higher Education and 
Training  (DHET)  were  to  receive  a  CPI-related  increase  from  National  Treasury,  in  real  terms  this 
would result in a decline in funding of HE institutions. This situation would be exacerbated by the 
growth in student numbers and enrolments targeted by the DHET. The consequence of this is that 
until April 2018, additional volume into the national system was being funded by diluting the existing 
pool of funding. The result was that institutions such as UCT, which has limited opportunity for further 
student  growth,  received  a  lesser  proportional  share  of  state  funding  for  a  number  of  years.  This 
trend has continued in 2021 and 2022. In March 2021, in presenting his budget to parliament, the 
Minister of Higher Education indicated cuts to budgets that will impact university block grants and 
NSFAS in 2022. A significant risk faced by the university is the potential capping of NSFAS funding 
for student accommodation, with a potential knock-on effect of some R220 million per annum on 
the financial aid underwriting by UCT (unless our own funding rules are changed). The ministry has 
undertaken to work with the sector in managing the impact of these cuts.
Fee income is expected to increase by inflation at best. There are some concerns with regard to the 
intake of 2022 and the overall level of enrolments which may unfavourably impact this. In addition, the 
DHET has indicated that they would like to implement the long-proposed Fee Regulatory Framework 
in 2023. This framework will further restrict UCT’s ability to increase fees.
The  Commercial  Development  unit  continues  to  manage  the  vacation  accommodation  and  staff 
housing with the intention of maximising the potential. The Conference Centre at the GSB continues 
to operate adding yet another diversified revenue stream to the University. Further opportunities are 
being explored as part of our medium-term financial sustainability plan.

University of Cape Town Annual Report 2021 67

www.uct.ac.zaThe  COVID-19  pandemic  and  subsequent  lockdown  have  impacted  these  third-stream  revenue 
operations  significantly.  2022  through  to  2024  are  considered  recovery  and  expansion  periods, 
and early indications suggest that existing commercial/hospitality operations will deliver on that front 
aligned with recoveries evidenced in the business and leisure markets.
We  remain  optimistic  that  given  our  history  of  appropriate  financial  management  and  forecasting, 
together with planned interventions as articulated in our medium-term financial sustainability plan, that 
UCT will weather the current economic challenges and continue on its path of excellence in teaching 
and research, supported by the well tested university integrated financial plan.

COUNCIL’S STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021

The consolidated annual financial statements for the financial year 2021 presented on pages 70 to 114 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the regulations 
gazetted by the Minister of Higher Education and Training in terms of the Higher Education Act, 1997, and include amounts based on judgements and estimates made by management as more fully laid out in the 
notes to the financial statements. The Council has also prepared other information as required to be included in this annual report and is responsible for both its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated 
annual financial statements.
The Council had adopted the going concern basis in the preparation of the annual financial statements. The Council has no reason to believe that the University of Cape Town is not a going concern in the 
foreseeable future based on forecasts and available cash resources. The Council believes that the financial statements confirm the viability of the institution.
The consolidated annual financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) who have been given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of the 
meetings of Council and all its committees. Council believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The annual financial statements set out on pages 
70 to 114 were authorised for issue on 24 June 2022, in accordance with a resolution of the University Council on 18 June 2022, and are signed on its behalf by:

EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OPINION
We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the  University  of  Cape  Town  and  its 
subsidiaries (the group) set out on pages 112 to 169, which comprise the consolidated statement of 
financial position as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
statement of changes in funds and cash flow statement for the year then ended, as well as notes to 
the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the 
consolidated financial position of the University of Cape Town as at 31 December 2021, and their 
financial  performance  and  cash  flows  for  the  year  then  ended  in  accordance  with  International 
Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Higher Education Act and the Regulations 
for reporting by Public Higher Education Institutions, 2014, issued in terms of the Higher Education 
Act of South Africa,1997.

BASIS FOR OPINION
We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  International  Standards  on  Auditing  (ISAs).  Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.
We  are  independent  of  the  University  in  accordance  with  the  Independent  Regulatory  Board 
for  Auditors’  Code  of  Professional  Conduct  for  Auditors  (IRBA  Code)  and  other  independence 
requirements applicable to performing audits of financial statements in South Africa. We have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IRBA Code and in accordance with other 
ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in South Africa. The IRBA Code is consistent 
with  the  corresponding  sections  of  the  International  Ethics  Standards  Board  for  Accountants’ 
International  Code  of  Ethics  for  Professional  Accountants  (Including  International  Independence 
Standards).

The examination of controls over the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is beyond the scope of 
the audit of the financial statements. Accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any changes that may have 
occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE 
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The  Council  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of 
the Higher Education Act of South Africa,1997 and the Regulations for reporting by Public Higher 
Education  Institutions,  2014,  issued  in  terms  of  the  Higher  Education  Act  of  South  Africa,1997, 
and for such internal control as the Council determines is necessary to enable the preparation of 
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.
In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Council  is  responsible  for  assessing  the 
University’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  relating  to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Council either intends to 
liquidate the University or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF 
THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial 
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Continued

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL 
PERFORMANCE REPORT

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
In  accordance  with  the  Public  Audit  Act  25  of  2004  (PAA)  and  the  general  notice  issued  in 
terms thereof, we have a responsibility to report on the usefulness and reliability of the reported 
performance information against predetermined objectives for selected objectives presented in the 
annual performance report. We performed procedures to identify material findings but not to gather 
evidence to express assurance.
Our  procedures  address  the  usefulness  and  reliability  of  the  reported  performance  information, 
which  must  be  based  on  the  University’s  approved  performance  planning  documents.  We  have 
not evaluated the completeness and appropriateness of the performance indicators included in the 
planning documents. Our procedures do not examine whether the actions taken by the University 
enabled service delivery. Our procedures do not extend to any disclosures or assertions relating to 
the extent of achievements in the current year or planned performance strategies and information 
in respect of future periods that may be included as part of the reported performance information. 
Accordingly, our findings do not extend to these matters.
We evaluated the usefulness and reliability of the reported performance information in accordance 
with  the  criteria  developed  from  the  performance  management  and  reporting  framework,  as 
defined  in  the  general  notice,  for  the  following  selected  objectives  presented  in  the  University’s 
annual performance report for the year ended 31 December 2021:

Objectives

Goal Area 1:  To develop and foster an organisational ethos that supports new 

ways of thinking and being

Goal Area 2:  To provide thought leadership on social justice
Goal Area 3:  To offer a holistic, innovative, future oriented education
Goal Area 4:  To conduct research solving Afrika’s problems

Pages in the annual 
performance report

15–18

15–18
18–21
21–27

We  performed  procedures  to  determine  whether  the  reported  performance  information  was 
consistent with the approved performance planning documents. We performed further procedures 
to determine whether the indicators and related targets were measurable and relevant, and assessed 
the reliability of the reported performance information to determine whether it was valid, accurate 
and complete.

We did not identify any material findings on the usefulness and reliability of the reported performance 
information for these objectives:
 » Goal Area 1: To develop and foster an organisational ethos that supports new ways of thinking 

and being

 » Goal Area 2: To provide thought leadership on social justice
 » Goal Area 3: To offer a holistic, innovative, future oriented education
 » Goal Area 4: To conduct research solving Afrika’s problems

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF COMPLIANCE 
WITH LEGISLATION

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
In accordance with the PAA and the general notice issued in terms thereof, we have a responsibility 
to report material findings on the University’s compliance with specific matters in key legislation. We 
performed procedures to identify findings but not to gather evidence to express assurance.
We did not identify any material findings on compliance with the specific matters in key legislation 
set out in the general notice issued in terms of the PAA.

OTHER INFORMATION
The Council is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included  in  the  “University  of  Cape  Town  Annual  Report  2021”.  The  other  information  does  not 
include  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  auditor’s  report  and  those  selected  objectives 
presented in the annual performance report that have been specifically reported in this auditor’s 
report.
Our  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  findings  on  the  reported  performance 
information  and  compliance  with  legislation  do  not  cover  the  other  information  and  we  do  not 
express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion on it.
In  connection  with  our  audit,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other  information  and,  in  doing  so, 
consider  whether  the  other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  and  the  selected  objectives  presented  in  the  annual  performance  report,  or  our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

INTERNAL CONTROL DEFICIENCIES

control.

www.uct.ac.zaINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE COUNCIL AND THE MINISTER OF HIGHER 
EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN Continued

 » evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, 
including the disclosures, and determine whether the consolidated financial statements represent 
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation

 » obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or 
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. 
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinion.

COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE 
CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE
We communicate with the Council regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.

ANNEXURE – AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE AUDIT
As part of an audit in accordance with the ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional  scepticism  throughout  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  the 
procedures performed on the reported performance information for selected objectives and on the 
University’s compliance with respect to the selected subject matters.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In addition to our responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial statements as described in 
this auditor’s report, we also:
 » identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements 
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, 
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting 
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control.

 » obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the University’s internal control.

 » evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 

estimates and related disclosures made by the Council.

 » conclude on the appropriateness of the Council’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. We also conclude, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists relating to events or conditions that may 
cast significant doubt on the ability of the University of Cape Town and its subsidiaries to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
about the material uncertainty or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion on the 
consolidated financial statements. Our conclusions are based on the information available to us at 
the date of this auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the University 
to cease operating as a going concern.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  University information

The  University  of  Cape  Town  was  established  in  1829  and  is  domiciled  in  South  Africa. 
The University’s registered address is Private Bag X3, Rondebosch, 7701, South Africa.
The consolidated annual financial statements of the University for the year ended 31 December 
2021 were authorised for issue on 24 June 2022, in accordance with a resolution of Council.
The  principal  activities  of  the  University  relate  to  teaching,  research  and  the  provision  of 
residential accommodation to students.

2.  Basis of preparation

The  consolidated  annual  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern 
and  historical  cost  basis,  except  where  stated  otherwise  (refer  to  accounting  policies).  The 
consolidated annual financial statements are presented in South African Rand and all values are 
rounded to the nearest thousand (R’000) except where otherwise indicated.
The  accounting  policies  adopted  are  consistent  with  those  of  the  previous  financial  year, 
except where the University has adopted the IFRS amendments that became effective during 
the year.
2.1 

New and Amended Standards and Interpretations
There were no amendments to IFRS that became effective for periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2021 that had a material impact on the University.
IFRS Amendments and IFRIC Interpretations issued but not yet effective
As  at  31  December  2021,  there  are  no  such  amendments  and  interpretations  that 
would have a material impact on the University.
Statement of compliance
The  consolidated  annual  financial  statements  of  the  University  of  Cape  Town  and 
its related entities have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and in the manner 
required by the Minister of Higher Education and Training in terms of section 41 of the 
Higher Education Act 101 of 1997 (as amended).

The UCT Lung Institute (Pty) Ltd

The Graduate School of Business 
Foundation

Nature of ownership
A trust of which the University of Cape Town appoints 
the trustees and is the sole beneficiary.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of the University of Cape 
Town.
A trust of which the University of Cape Town has 
appointed the trustees.
A wholly-owned subsidiary of the University of Cape 
Town.
A private company where the University has appointed 
directors to the Board and has a 57% equity holding.

The financial statements of related entities are consolidated from the date on which 
the University acquires effective control, up to the date that such effective control 
ceases. The University controls an entity when it exposed or has rights to variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and can affect those returns through its 
power over the entity.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or 
convertible are considered when assessing whether the University controls another 
entity.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an 
acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured 
at  acquisition  date  fair  value  and  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interest  in  the 
acquiree.
For each business combination, the University measures the non-controlling interest 
in  the  acquiree  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets.
Acquisition  costs  incurred  are  expensed  and  included  in  administrative  expenses. 
When there is a disposal or loss of control of a related entity, the consolidated financial 
statements would include the results for the part of the reporting period during which 
the University had control. Any difference between the net proceeds on disposal and 
the carrying amount of the subsidiary is recognised in the surplus for the respective 
period.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is 
re-measured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognised 
in surplus or deficit.
Any  contingent  consideration  to  be  transferred  by  the  acquirer  will  be  recognised 
at  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  Contingent  consideration  classified  as  an  asset 
or  liability  that  is  a  financial  instrument  and  within  the  scope  of  IFRS  9:  Financial 

2.5 

Instruments, is measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit 
or  loss.  All  balances,  transactions,  unrealised  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  intra-
University transactions, are eliminated in full.
The  University  re-assesses  whether  or  not  it  controls  an  investee  if  facts  and 
circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of 
control. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of 
during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the 
University gains control until the date the University ceases to control the subsidiary.
Segment information and accumulated funds
A segment is a recognised component of the University that is engaged in undertaking 
activities and providing services that are subject to risks and returns different from 
those of other segments. The segmentation presented in the financial statements is 
in  terms  of  the  guidelines  prescribed  by  the  Department  of  Higher  Education  and 
Training and is specifically not in terms of IFRS 8: Operating Segments. The operating 
businesses are managed separately but fall under the oversight of the University of 
Cape Town’s executive leadership.
2.5.1 

2.5.2 

2.5.3 

2.5.4 

Council-controlled unrestricted
The Council-controlled segment predominantly represents the teaching 
component of the University. Decision making rights relating to income 
earned in this segment rest with Council.
Specifically-funded activities restricted
The  specifically-funded  activities  restricted  segment  consists  mainly  of 
research activities. Decision making rights over income earned and related 
expenses rest with researchers. Council retains an oversight role with regard 
to  ensuring  that  expenditure  is  in  accordance  with  the  mandate  received 
from funders and University policies.
Student and staff housing restricted
The  student  and  staff  housing  segment  relates  to  the  provision  of 
accommodation  to  both  students  and  staff.  The  availability  of  this 
accommodation  is  a  strategic  initiative  aimed  at  ensuring  that  students 
adopt the University as their preferred place of study and that the University 
is able to attract and retain appropriate staff.
Endowed funds income
Income  from  specific  endowments,  comprising  investment  income  and 
realised  profits  arising  from  the  sale  of  investments,  is  recognised  in  the 
Consolidated  Statement  of  Comprehensive  Income  as  designated  for 
specific purposes in the period in which it accrues.
It  is  the  University’s  policy  to  utilise  only  a  portion  of  this  income  and  to 
reinvest the unutilised portion in the underlying endowed funds in order to 
preserve the real value of the capital base.

2.6 

Transfers between funds
Transfers between funds are reflected in two areas.
2.6.1 

Operational transfers
The  transfer  of  funds  is  required  for  operational  purposes  between  the 
three  main  operational  segments  namely,  Council-Controlled  Unrestricted, 
Specifically-Funded  Activities  Restricted,  and  Student  and  Staff  Housing 
Restricted. These transfers are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.
Endowment related transfers
These  transfers  relate  to  transfers  to  or  from  the  endowment  as  a  result 
of its investment activities. The transfers are reflected in the Statement of 
Changes in Fund Balances.

2.6.2 

3.  Significant accounting judgements and estimates

The  preparation  of  the  University’s  consolidated  annual  financial  statements  requires 
management  to  make  judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, 
at reporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates may result 
in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or 
liability affected in the future.
In  the  process  of  applying  the  University’s  accounting  policies,  management  has  made  the 
following judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have significant effects 
on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
3.1 

Judgements
3.1.1 

Revenue from contracts with customers
The  University  applied  the  following  judgements  that  significantly  affect 
the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with 
customers:
Determining the timing of satisfaction of research services
The University concluded that the revenue for research services is to be 
recognised  over  time  because  the  customer  simultaneously  receives  and 
consumes  the  benefits  provided  by  the  University.  The  fact  that  another 
entity  would  not  need  to  re-perform  the  research  that  the  University 
has  undertaken  to  date  demonstrates  that  the  customer  simultaneously 
receives  and  consumes  the  benefits  provided  by  the  University.  The 
University  recognises  revenue  on  the  basis  of  stage  completion  for  each 
research contract. The stage of completion is determined according to the 
deliverables noted in each contract, as well as the University’s performance 
against them.

Principal versus agent considerations
The University enters into collaborative research agreements between itself, 
funders  and  other  universities.  Under  these  agreements,  the  University 
receives  funds  from  the  funders,  and  pays  it  over  to  other  universities 
when performance obligations have been met. The University recognises 
revenue to the extent that it controls the research services to be provided 
to the funders, and in such instances, the University is the principal. For the 
services provided by other universities, the University has determined that 
it does not control the research services provided by the other universities 
before  they  are  transferred  to  the  funders.  The  following  factors  indicate 
that the University does not control the services before they are transferred 
to the funders:
•  The  University  is  not  primarily  responsible  for  fulfilling  the  promise  to 

provide the research services; and/or

•  The University has no discretion to determine the price of the services.
Therefore, the University determined that it is an agent in these contracts 
and does not recognise revenue relating to these contracts.
Investments
In  assessing  the  control  over  investments,  the  purpose  and  design  of  the 
investments were considered, as well as the identification of the activities of 
the investee that significantly affect the returns of the investee, management 
identified how decisions about these activities are made and concluded on 
whether the University has the rights to direct these activities. In addition, 
consideration was given to whether or not the University is exposed, or has 
rights, to the variability associated with the returns of the investee and lastly 
management considered whether or not the University has the ability to use 
its own power of the investee to affect its own returns.
The University has determined that it has control over the entities listed in 
note  2.4.  The  University  therefore  controls  the  entities  and  consolidates 
them accordingly.

3.  Significant accounting judgements and estimates Continued

3.1 

Judgements Continued
3.1.3 

Provision for expected credit losses (ECLs) of trade receivables and 
student fee receivables
The University uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables 
and student fees receivable. The provision rates are based on days past due 
and historic default rates.
The provision matrix is initially based on the University’s historical observed 
default rates. The University will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical 
credit  loss  experience  with  forward-looking  information.  For  instance,  if 
forecast  economic  conditions  are  expected  to  deteriorate  over  the  next 
year  which  can  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  defaults  in  the  higher 
education sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting 
date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the 
forward-looking estimates are analysed.
The  assessment  of  the  correlation  between  historically  observed  default 
rates, forecasted economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The 
amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecasted 
economic conditions. The University’s historical credit loss experience and 
forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of students’ 
or customers’ actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on 
the University’s trade receivables and student fees receivables is disclosed 
in note 9.
Leases
Where the University is a lessee, the lease term of contracts with renewal 
and termination options is determined as the non-cancellable term of the 
lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if 
it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option 
to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The  University  has  several  lease  contracts  that  include  extension  and 
termination options. The University applies judgement in evaluating whether 
it is reasonably certain whether or not to exercise the option to renew or 
terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an 
economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination. After 
the commencement date, the University reassesses the lease term if there 

3.1.4 

is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and 
affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to 
terminate.
The  University  included  the  renewal  period  as  part  of  the  lease  term  for 
leases  of  buildings  relating  to  student  accommodation  with  shorter  non-
cancellable period (i.e. one to three years) and leases of buildings relating 
to  research  and  academic  activities.  The  University  typically  exercises  its 
option to renew these leases because of the current shortage of student 
accommodation, and the negative impact to the University’s core activities 
should  academic  and  research  buildings  not  be  readily  available.  The 
renewal periods for leases of buildings relating to student accommodation 
with longer non-cancellable periods (i.e. greater than three years) are not 
included as part of the lease term as these are not reasonably certain to be 
exercised. The University has plans in place to acquire/construct buildings 
which will amply accommodate students in future and thus no further leases 
for student accommodation should be needed.
In addition, the renewal options for leases of motor vehicles are not included 
as  part  of  the  lease  term  because  the  University  typically  leases  motor 
vehicles  for  not  more  than  five  years  and,  hence,  is  not  exercising  any 
renewal options. Furthermore, the periods covered by termination options 
are included as part of the lease term only when they are reasonably certain 
not to be exercised. Refer to note 20.

3.2 

Estimation uncertainty
The  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and  other  key  sources  of  estimation 
uncertainty  at  the  reporting  date,  that  have  a  significant  risk  of  causing  a  material 
adjustment  to the carrying amounts  of assets  and  liabilities within the next  financial 
year are set out below.
3.2.1 

Investments – judgements over fair value
Financial  assets  within  the  scope  of  IFRS  9:  Financial  Instruments: 
Recognition  and  Measurement  are  classified  as  financial  assets  at  fair 
value  through  profit  or  loss.  Management  determines  the  classification  of 
its financial assets at initial recognition. When the fair value of investments 
recorded in the Statement of Financial Position cannot be measured based 
on  quoted  prices  in  active  markets,  their  fair  value  is  measured  using 
valuation  techniques  such  as  director’s  valuations  based  on  recent  equity 
transactions  or  discounted  cash  flows  (DCF)  model.  The  inputs  to  these 
models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this 
is not feasible, a degree of estimates is required in establishing fair values. 
Estimates include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk 
and volatility. Additional details on these assumptions are provided in note 6.

3.2.3 

Depreciation
At the end of each financial year management reviews property, plant and 
equipment to assess whether the estimated useful lives and estimated residual 
values applied to each asset are appropriate. The useful lives of assets are 
estimated by reviewing the degree to which assets are fully depreciated, but 
still remain on the asset register and are in use. The University for the most 
part uses its asset until future rewards no longer accrue. Additional details on 
these assumptions are provided in note 4.8.
Typically, assets are assessed as having no residual value when calculating 
the depreciable amount because assets are of little value at the time they 
are sold or decommissioned.

Gratuity liability for academic staff
The University pays a gratuity to academic staff on retirement, retrenchment 
or  death  in  special  circumstances.  In  order  to  estimate  the  probability  of 
incurring  this  liability,  management  make  assumptions  in  respect  of  the 
number of academic staff that will reach retirement. In addition, to calculate 
the  fair  value  of  the  liability  the  University  needs  to  make  assumptions 
regarding both expected future salary increases and a suitable discount rate. 
Additional details on these assumptions are provided in note 12.1.
Post-retirement medical aid benefits obligation
The University’s future obligation in respect of post-retirement medical aid 
contributions is actuarially valued based on the projected unit credit method. 
For the purpose of the valuation at 31 December 2021, key assumptions 
were made in respect of the discount rate, expected inflation on medical aid 
contributions,  expected  age  of  retirements  and  mortality  rates.  Additional 
details on these assumptions are provided in note 12.3.
Student fees receivables
At  year  end  management  makes  an  estimate  of  the  amount  of  total 
outstanding student fee debt that it expects to hand over to external debt 
collectors. In addition, management estimates the amounts that it expects 
to  recover  from  outstanding  balances  handed  over  based  upon  the  age 
profile  of  debts  handed  over.  The  estimate  of  current  balances  that  may 
be handed over is based on outstanding balances at 31 December of the 
preceding year as a percentage of the total expected fees. The provision 
is therefore based on past write-off experience which has been analysed 
and updated with forward-looking information, as well as the current year’s 
performance. A provision for ECLs is raised based on these estimates. Refer 
to note 9.

Foreign currency translation
The  consolidated  annual  financial  statements  are  presented  in  South  African  Rand, 
which is the University’s functional and presentation currency. Transactions in foreign 
currencies are initially recorded at the exchange currency rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange currency rate ruling at the reporting date. All differences are taken to surplus 
or deficit in the year in which they arise.
Non-monetary items carried at cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction, whilst assets carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate 
when the fair value was determined.
When  a  gain  or  loss  on  a  non-monetary  item  is  recognised  directly  in  other 
comprehensive  income,  any  exchange  component  of  that  gain  or  loss  shall  be 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Conversely, when a gain or loss 
on  a  non-monetary  item  is  recognised  directly  in  surplus  or  deficit,  any  exchange 
component of that gain or loss shall be recognised directly in surplus or deficit.
Revenue recognition
The University has different revenue streams and the following specific recognition 
criteria must be met before revenue is recognised:
4.2.1 

Subsidies and grants
State subsidies and grants for general purposes are recognised as income in 
the financial year to which they relate.
Subsidies and grants for specific research purposes are recognised as income 
in the financial year in which they accrue to the University in accordance 
with  the  relevant  grants  and  agreements.  Such  subsidies  and  grants  are 
presented  separately  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Comprehensive 
Income.
Subsidies and grants relating to specific expenses are not offset against the 
expense.
Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as deferred revenue and 
released to income in equal annual amounts over the expected useful life of 
the relevant asset.

included 

Donations and gifts
Revenue  received  for  designated  specific  purposes  arises  from  contracts 
which are not IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, grants and 
donations.  Such  revenue  is  recognised  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of 
Comprehensive Income over time in the financial period in which progress is 
satisfied in accordance with the relevant agreement.
Donations  received  for  endowment  purposes  are 
in  the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which 
they are received.
Interest
Revenue  is  recognised  as  interest  accrues,  using  the  effective  interest 
method  which  is  the  rate  that  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts 
through  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument  to  the  net  carrying 
amount of the financial asset.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Revenue from contracts with customers
Revenue  from  contracts  with  customers  relates  to  income  from  research 
contracts, not dealt with in 4.2.2 above. This revenue is recognised when 
control  of  the  goods  or  services  are  transferred  to  the  customer  at  an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which the University expects to 
be  entitled  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  The  University  has 
generally  concluded  that  it  is  the  principal  in  its  revenue  arrangements 
because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them 
to the customer other than in instances mentioned in 3.1.1 above.
In determining the transaction price for the research contracts revenue, the 
University considers the effects of variable consideration. If the consideration 
in a contract includes a variable amount, the University estimates the amount 
of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the 
goods to the customer.
4.2.5.1 

Income from contracts
Contract assets
A  contract  asset  is  the  right  to  consideration  in  exchange  for 
goods  or  services  transferred  to  the  customer  only  when  this 
right  is  conditional  upon  something  other  than  the  passage  of 
time. If the University performs by transferring goods or services 
to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before 
payment  is  due,  a  contract  asset  is  recognised  for  the  earned 
consideration that is conditional.

Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services 
to a customer for which the University has received consideration 
(or  an  amount  of  consideration  is  due)  from  the  customer.  If  a 
customer pays consideration before the University transfers goods 
or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when 
the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). 
Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the University 
performs under the contract.
4.2.5.2  Tuition and other fee income

Tuition and residence fees charged are applicable to one academic 
and financial year and are recognised in that year. The University 
has  assessed  that  the  students  simultaneously  receive  and 
consume the benefits provided within the year, as such revenue is 
recognised over time.
Scholarships,  bursaries  and  other  financial  aid  provided  by  the 
University to students for tuition and residence fees are recognised 
as a reduction of fees.
4.2.5.3  Rendering of services

Revenue,  involving  the  rendering  of  services,  is  recognised  over 
time to the extent that the service has been provided. Revenue 
includes  consulting  services,  short  course  fees  and  club  hotel 
revenues. When the University is not able to reasonably measure 
the outcome of the obligation under the contract, but expects to 
recover  the  costs  incurred  in  satisfying  the  obligations  to  date, 
revenue  shall  be  recognised  only  to  the  extent  that  expenses 
incurred are eligible to be recovered.

4.3 

Retirement benefits
4.3.1 

Defined contribution retirement plan
Employer  contributions  to  the  University  of  Cape  Town  Retirement  Fund 
are  recognised  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Comprehensive  Income 
in the period during which the employees render services to the University.
Medical aid benefits
Employer contributions to a medical aid fund are recognised as an expense 
in the period during which the employees render services to the University.

Gratuity liability for academic staff
This  relates  to  the  policy  to  pay  a  gratuity  on  death,  retrenchment  or 
retirement where a member of the academic staff has not taken study and 
research leave. Study and research leave may be granted to allow academic 
staff uninterrupted research work, usually away from Cape Town, and is not 
regarded as a vacation. The method used in determining the value of this 
provision is one where a discount rate is applied against projected valuations 
in order to establish a present value.

Leave liability for professional, administrative and support staff
An accrual is raised for the estimated liability for annual leave because of 
services rendered by professional, administrative and support staff as at the 
reporting date. The method used in determining the value of this provision 
is one where a discount rate is applied against projected valuations in order 
to establish a present value.
Defined benefit post-retirement medical aid liability
The University has an obligation to provide certain post-retirement medical 
aid  benefits  to  its  eligible  employees  and  pensioners.  The  University  is 
required to provide a defined amount of the medical aid contribution due. 
The plan is not funded.
The  present  value  of  the  future  medical  aid  subsidies  for  current  service 
costs is actuarially determined annually in accordance with IAS 19: Employee 
Benefits.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit 
method, incorporating actuarial assumptions.
Defined benefit post-retirement medical aid liability continued
The  liability  is  recognised  at  the  reporting  date.  Any  curtailment  benefits 
or settlement amounts are recognised against income as incurred. Service 
costs  comprising  current  service  costs,  past  service  costs  and  interest 
expense are recognised in surplus or deficit for the year when incurred.
The  defined  benefit  liability  is  the  present  value  of  the  defined  benefit 
obligation.  Actuarial  gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  the  Consolidated 
Statement of Other Comprehensive income in the year they arise.

Borrowing costs
Borrowing  costs  that  are  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition,  construction  or 
production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period that is required to 
complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Qualifying assets are assets that 
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use. Other borrowing 
costs are recognised as an expense.
Research costs
Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Library acquisitions
Library books and other library materials are expensed in the year in which they are 
acquired.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost. The cost of an asset 
comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset 
to the location and condition necessary for it to operate as intended by management.
Subsequently,  property  plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Subsequent costs are included in the 
asset’s carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the University and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Maintenance and repairs, which do not meet these criteria, are expensed as incurred. 
Donated assets are initially recorded at fair value at the date of donation.
Land is not depreciated as it is deemed to have an indefinite useful life. Depreciation 
on assets under construction commences when the asset is ready for use.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis estimated to 
write each asset down to its estimated residual value over the estimated useful lives of 
the assets which range as follows:

Buildings
Leasehold improvements
Motor vehicles
Furniture and equipment
Computers, servers and network infrastructure

The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reviewed, 
and  adjusted  if  appropriate,  at  each  financial  year  end.  An  item  of  property,  plant 
and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of 
the  asset  (calculated  as  the  difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds  and  the 
carrying amount of the asset) is included in the surplus in the period in which the asset 
is derecognised.

4.9 

Impairment of non-financial assets
The University assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an 
asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing 
for an asset is required, the University makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell 
and  its  value-in-use.  In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are 
discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into 
account, if available. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable 
amount,  the  asset  is  considered  impaired  and  is  written  down  to  its  recoverable 
amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication 
that  previously  recognised  impairment  losses  may  no  longer  exist  or  may  have 
decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change 
in  the  estimates  used  to  determine  the  asset’s  recoverable  amount  since  the  last 
impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is 
increased to its recoverable amount.
That  increased  amount  cannot  exceed  the  carrying  amount  that  would  have  been 
determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in surplus or deficit.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate 
the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over 
its remaining useful life.

Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  initially  recognised  in  the  Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position when the University becomes party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument. The trade date method of accounting has been adopted 
for ‘regular way’ purchase or sale of financial assets. The trade date is the date that the 
University commits to purchase or sell an asset. A ‘regular way’ contract is a contract 
for the purchase or sale of financial assets that requires delivery of the assets within 
the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace 
concerned.
With  the  exception  of  trade  and  student  debtors  that  do  not  contain  a  significant 
finance  component,  the  University  initially  measures  financial  assets  and  liabilities 
at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or liability not at fair value through 
surplus or deficit, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or 
issue of the financial asset or liability. Trade and student debtors that do not contain a 

4.10  Financial assets and liabilities

significant financing component are measured at transaction price in accordance with 
IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (refer to accounting policy 4.2.5). 
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition as subsequently measured at fair 
value  through  surplus  or  deficit,  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  or 
amortised cost, as appropriate.
The  classification  of  financial  assets  at  initial  recognition  depends  on  the  financial 
asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the University’s business model for 
managing them.
Fair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a 
liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market  participants  at  the  measurement 
date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to 
sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
• 
• 

In the principal market for the asset or liability
In  the  absence  of  a  principal  market,  in  the  most  advantageous  market  for  the 
asset or liability

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market 
participants  would  use  when  pricing  the  asset  or  liability,  assuming  that  market 
participants act in their economic best interest.
The  University  uses  valuation  techniques  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances 
and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of 
relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All  assets  and  liabilities  for  which  fair  value  is  measured  or  disclosed  in  the  financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based 
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1:
Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2:
Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3:
Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value 
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value 
on  a  recurring  basis,  the  University  determines  whether  transfers  have  occurred 
between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest 
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of 
each reporting period.
Fair-value related disclosures for financial instruments and non-financial assets that are 
measured at fair value or where fair values are disclosed, are summarised in note 23.7.

Financial assets at amortised cost and receivables
The  University  measures  financial  assets  at  amortised  cost  if  both  the 
following conditions are met:
•  The financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to 

hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and

•  The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates 
to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding.

Financial  assets  at  amortised  cost  are  subsequently  measured  using  the 
effective  interest  (EIR)  method  and  are  subject  to  impairment.  Gains  and 
losses  are  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  when  the  asset  is  derecognised, 
modified or impaired.
Financial assets at amortised cost and receivables continued
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value.  They 
are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost.  For  the  purpose  of  the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist 
of cash on hand and balances at banks, net of outstanding bank overdrafts, 
and short-term deposits.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  include  financial  assets 
held  for  trading,  financial  assets  designated  upon  initial  recognition  at  fair 
value through surplus or deficit, or financial assets mandatorily required to 
be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if 
they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. 
Financial  assets  with  cash  flows  that  are  not  solely  payments  of  principal 
and interest are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
Debt instruments may be designated at fair value through surplus or deficit 
on  initial  recognition  if  doing  so  eliminates,  or  significantly  reduces,  an 
accounting mismatch.

Management  is  primarily  focused  on  fair  value  information  relating  to  its 
investments,  which  includes  equity  and  debt  instruments,  and  uses  that 
information to assess the assets’ performance and to make decisions. The 
business model is to manage and evaluate investments on a fair value basis, 
to hold investments for capital appreciation and to preserve the real value 
of  the  capital  base.  As  a  result,  the  University’s  investments  have  been 
classified at fair value through profit and loss with net changes in fair value 
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
This  category  includes  derivative  instruments,  listed  equity  investments, 
collective investment schemes, unlisted equity investments, debt instruments 
such  as  government  and  corporate  bonds,  and  money  market  deposits. 
Dividends on listed equity investments are also recognised as other income 
in the Income Statement when the right of payment has been established.
All derivative instruments of the University are carried as assets when the 
fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities comprise accounts payable, student deposits and accrued 
liabilities and interest-bearing borrowings.
The  University’s  financial  liabilities  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value  and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method.  Gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  surplus  or  deficit  when  the 
liabilities are de-recognised as well as through the amortisation process.

Financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a 
group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from 
the University’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when:
The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.
The  University  has  transferred  its  rights  to  receive  cash  flows  from  the 
asset; or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; 
and either:
a. 

 The University has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of 
the asset, or
 The University has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the 
risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

Financial assets Continued
When the University has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an 
asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to 
what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has 
neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of 
the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the University continues to 
recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the University’s continuing 
involvement.  In  that  case,  the  University  also  recognises  an  associated 
liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a 
basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the University has retained.
Continuing  involvement  that  takes  the  form  of  a  guarantee  over  the 
transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount 
of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the University 
could be required to repay.
Financial liabilities
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where  an  existing  financial  liability  is  replaced  by  another  from  the  same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-
recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and 
the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in surplus 
or deficit.
Financial  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  and  the  net  amount  reported  in 
the  Statement  of  Financial  Position  only  when  there  is  currently  a  legally 
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts; and there is an intention 
either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.

4.12 

Impairment of financial assets at amortised cost
 The University considers debtors in default when contractual payments are 60 days 
past due. The University recognises an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not 
held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between 
the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows 
that the company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original 
effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of 
collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

4.13 

For trade receivables and student fees receivables, the University applies a simplified 
approach  in  calculating  ECLs.  Therefore,  the  University  does  not  track  changes  in 
credit  risk,  but  instead  recognises  a  loss  allowance  based  on  lifetime  ECLs  at  each 
reporting date. The University has established a provision matrix that is based on its 
historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the 
debtors and the economic environment. Financial asset at amortised cost are written 
off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
Investment in associates
The University’s investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method 
of  accounting.  An  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  the  University  has  significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating 
policy  decisions  of  the  investee  but  not  control  or  jointly  control  these  policies.  If 
the University holds, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the voting power of the 
investee,  it  is  assumed  that  the  University  has  significant  influence  unless  it  can  be 
clearly demonstrated that this is not the case.
Under  the  equity  method,  the  investment  in  the  associate  is  initially  recognised  at 
cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the University’s 
share  of  the  surplus  or  deficit  of  the  associate  after  the  date  of  acquisition.  The 
University’s share of the surplus or deficit is recognised in the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income.
If the University’s share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the 
associate, the University discontinues recognising its share of further losses.
After  the  University’s  interest  is  reduced  to  zero,  additional  losses  are  provided  for, 
and a liability recognised only to the extent that the University has incurred legal or 
constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
After  application  of  the  equity  method,  including  recognising  the  associate’s  losses, 
the  University  determines  whether  it  is  necessary  to  recognise  any  additional 
impairment loss with respect to the University’s net investment in the associate.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, 
the University recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, 
in  the  Statement  of  Changes  in  Funds.  Unrealised  gains  and  losses  resulting  from 
transactions between the University and the associates are eliminated to the extent of 
the interest in the associate. The reporting dates of the associates and the University 
are  identical  and  the  associate’s  accounting  policies  conform  to  those  used  by  the 
University for like-transactions and events in similar circumstances.

Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value 
is the replacement cost of inventories.
Inventories are made up of consumables.
Leases
The  determination  of  whether  an  arrangement  is,  or  contains  a  lease,  is  based  on 
the substance of the arrangement at inception date of; whether the fulfilment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets, or the arrangement 
conveys a right to use the asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
4.15.1 

University as a lessee
The University applies a single recognition and measurement approach for 
all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The 
University recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-
use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.
Right-of-use assets
Right-of-use assets are measured at the commencement date of the lease, 
equal to the lease liability raised. Subsequently, the right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, 
and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-
use  assets  includes  the  amount  of  lease  liabilities  recognised,  initial  direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated 
useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Buildings 
Motor vehicles 

3 to 47 years
14 months to 7 years

If  ownership  of  the  leased  asset  transfers  to  the  University  at  the  end 
of  the  lease  term  or  the  cost  reflects  the  exercise  of  a  purchase  option, 
depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the University recognises lease 
liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over 
the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease 
incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or 
a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. 
The  lease  payments  also  include  payments  of  penalties  for  terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the University exercising the option to 
terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate 
are recognised as expenses in the period in which the event or condition 
that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the University uses its 
incremental  borrowing  rate  at  the  lease  commencement  date  because 
the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect 
the  accretion  of  interest  and  reduced  for  the  lease  payments  made.  In 
addition,  the  carrying  amount  of  lease  liabilities  is  remeasured  if  there  is 
a  modification,  i.e.  a  change  in  the  lease  term  or  a  change  in  the  lease 
payments.
Short-term leases and leases of low value assets
The  University  applies  the  short-term  lease  recognition  exemption  to  its 
short-term (one year or less) leases of property. It also applies the lease of 
low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that 
are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and 
leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
University as a lessor
Leases where the University does not transfer substantially all the risks and 
benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Lease 
income from operating leases is recognised in income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating 
lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rentals 
are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

Due  to  a  change  in  the  underlying  nature  of  the  investment,  R331  931  927  (2020: 
R307 829 634) relating to the FutureGrowth portfolio in the University of Cape Town 
Foundation has been disclosed as local capital market interest-bearing investments in the 
current year and local mutual funds in the prior year.
No investments were pledged as security during the financial year.

Fair value hierarchy
As at 31 December 2021, the University held the above financial instruments measured at fair 
value. The University uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value 
of financial instruments by valuation technique:

Level 1:
Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2:
Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value 
are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3:
Techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are 
not based on observable market data.
All corporate bonds are considered to be classified as level 2 investments, with government 
bonds  classified  as  level  1.  All  corporate  and  government  bonds  have  been  grouped  in 
aggregate under local capital market interest-bearing investments. Derivative instruments are 
entered into with reputable financial institutions. The credit exposure of derivatives is subject 
to movements in the appropriate indices. The portfolio managers make limited use of futures 
and option contracts for hedging purposes to manage the equity exposure flexibly and cost 
effectively. This is done in order to achieve desired equity exposures.
Level  2  investments  consist  of  money  market  instruments,  corporate  bonds,  equity  linked 
derivatives and some investments in collective investment schemes. Investments are deposits 
held with financial institutions. The fair values of these amounts reflect the time value of money.
The fair values of the quoted notes and bonds are based on price quotations at the reporting 
date. The University enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, 
principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
Level 3 unlisted equity investments were valued based on previous recent market transactions 
adjusted where necessary for significant changes to the business subsequent to the date of 
these transactions. As no reasonable change in these adjustments would give rise to a material 
impact on surplus or deficits, no sensitivities to these inputs have been presented.

Accounts  receivables  are  non-interest-bearing  and  are  generally  settled  on  30-day  terms. 
The trade receivables total is net of the impairment provision, calculated using the ECL method.
Sundry receivables consist primarily of amounts due from external third parties, which operate 
through UCT but do not form part of UCT’s activities, of R71.9 million (2020: R29.2 million). 
Interest receivable amounts to R40.3m (2020: R22.5m).
The  above  total  for  accounts  receivable  and  prepayments  disclosed  in  note  23.7  excludes 
prepayments and property deposits, as these are not financial instruments as defined.

The University considers debtors in default when contractual payments are 60 days past due. 
These  are  then  individually  considered  for  impairment.  The  trade  receivables  are  grouped 
according  to  days  outstanding  in  order  to  calculate  the  expected  loss  rate  per  grouping. 
See note 23.5 on credit risk of trade receivables, which explains how the University manages 
and measures credit quality of trade receivables.
At year end, trade receivables at a nominal value of R10.2 million (2020: R10.2 million) were 
impaired and fully provided for. Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables

Due to the nature of its operations, the University tracks outstanding fees on an academic year 
basis. The University considers all prior years’ outstanding fees as past due. The University 
anticipates  that  the  majority  of  current  year  fees  will  be  settled  as  part  of  the  registration 
process for the 2022 academic year. While it is University policy that returning students are 
not allowed to register with outstanding fee debt, Council resolved that all students who are 
eligible to re-register on academic grounds be allowed to register for the 2022 academic year, 
irrespective of any outstanding fees. This concession applies to the 2022 academic year only, 
and does not apply to students registered for courses at the Graduate School of Business 
(GSB), or who are international students from continents other than Africa.
As  at  31  December  2021,  student  receivables  with  a  nominal  value  of  R141.0  million 
(2020:  R137.0  million)  were  impaired  and  fully  provided  for.  The  student  fee  receivable 
is  grouped  according  to  the  year  in  which  the  fees  were  earned,  in  order  to  calculate  the 
expected loss rate per grouping. Movements in the provision for impairment of student fees 
receivables were as follows:

Cash  at  bank  earns  interest  at  floating  rates  based  on  daily  bank  deposit  rates.  Short-term 
deposits are redeemable at 24 hours’ notice, are drawn down or added to depending on the 
immediate cash requirements of the University, and earn interest at the respective short-term 
deposit rates. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.
At year end the University’s cash was invested with institutions with the following Moody’s 
long-term ratings:
Standard Bank  Ba2
Absa Bank 
Ba2
Grindrod Bank  Ba1
At  31  December  2021,  the  University  has  an  undrawn  loan  facility  of  R865  million 
(2020: R857 million) with the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) to be utilised 
over time to finance infrastructure projects which are self-sustaining.
The weighted average effective interest rate on local short-term bank deposits was 4.42% 
(2020: 5.51%). Cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of 
cash flows are as stated above.

Gratuity Liability for Academic Staff
The University has a policy to pay a gratuity on death, retrenchment or retirement 
where a member of the academic staff has not taken study and research leave. Study 
and  research  leave  may  be  granted  to  allow  academic  staff  uninterrupted  research 
work, usually away from Cape Town, and is not regarded as a vacation.
In estimating the liability, management has calculated the projected credit unit number 
of leave days by using a 10-year average.
In addition, in order to fairly value the liability, management has assumed that future 
salary increases will be 7% (2020: 7.6% per annum), while the discount rate that has 
been applied is 11.6% (2020: 13.2%).
A one percentage point change in the assumed rate of increase in future salaries and 
discount rate would have the following effect on the obligation:

12.3  Post-Retirement Medical Aid Benefit Obligation

The University’s obligations towards post-retirement medical aid benefits, determined 
in terms of IAS 19: Employee Benefits, are set out below.
For  the  purpose  of  the  valuation  at  31  December  the  following  key  assumptions 
were  made;  discount  rate  11.6%  (2020:  13.2%);  expected  inflation  on  medical  aid 
contributions  of  9%  (2020:  10.0%).  Post  retirement  mortality  is  based  on  PA  (90) 
ultimate mortality tables rated down three years (2020: three years).
It is assumed, in both the current and prior year, that 2.5% of members present will 
retire at each age from 55 to 59 and ages 61 and 62; and 15% of members will retire 
at age 60; and 10% of members at ages 63 and 64 will retire; with all the remaining 
members  retiring  at  age  65.  The  expected  average  remaining  working  lives  of  the 
employees participating in the scheme is 16 years (2020: 17 years).
A one percentage point change in the assumed rate of increase in medical aid inflation 
would have the following effect on the defined benefit obligation:

Trade and other payables are non-interest-bearing and are normally settled on 30-day terms.
The National Research Foundation (NRF) grant deposit is based on the expenditure claim rate 
against grants, awarded to grant holders at the University and is given to bridge the financing 
of  NRF  funded  research  projects.  Regular  expenditure  claims  ensure  the  preservation  of 
the  capital  of  the  grant  deposit  and  the  interest  earned  from  this  investment  supports  the 
administration and management of NRF RISA research funding by the University.
Other  payables  consist  primarily  of  amounts  due  to  external  third  parties,  which  operate 
through UCT but do not form part of UCT’s activities, of R233.9 million (2020: R94.7 million).

UCT expenses

The  University  has  several  lease  contracts  that  include  extension  and  termination 
options.  These  options  are  negotiated  by  management  to  provide  flexibility  in 
managing  the  leased-asset  portfolio  and  align  with  the  University’s  business  needs. 
Management exercises significant judgement in determining whether these extension 
and termination options are reasonably certain to be exercised (see Note 3.1.4).
Set  out  below  are  the  undiscounted  potential  future  rental  payments  relating  to 
periods following the exercise date of extension and termination options that are not 
included in the lease term:

The transfer relating to the IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers treatment 
of  bursaries  is  necessary  as  the  standard  requires  that  bursaries  that  offset  tuition 
costs be offset against tuition income, and not be disclosed as expenses. However, 
as all tuition income is Council-controlled, the portion of specifically-funded activities’ 
bursaries that are offset against tuition income represents a transfer of expenses from 
specifically-funded activities to Council-controlled, and this transfer incorporates this 
impact.

University of Cape Town Annual Report 2021 105

www.uct.ac.zaNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

23.  Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The  University’s  principal  financial  instruments  comprise  equities  and  debt  instruments 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, accounts receivables, student fee receivables, 
cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, interest-bearing borrowings and accrued liabilities. 
The  University  manages  a  substantial  portfolio  of  financial  assets  with  a  long-term  view  to 
growing the portfolio in order to provide financial stability and support for new initiatives and 
strategic choices.
The  University  may  enter  into  derivative  transactions.  The  University’s  portfolio  managers 
make limited use of futures and option contracts for hedging purposes only to manage the 
equity exposure flexibly and cost effectively. This is done in order to achieve desired equity 
exposures.  Forward  exchange  contracts  may  be  entered  into  to  mitigate  risks  relating  to 
transactional currency exposures.
The main risks arising from the University’s financial instruments are market, credit and liquidity 
risks. The Council, through its Finance and Joint Investment Committees, reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks which are summarised below:
23.1  Market Risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types 
of risk: price, currency and interest rate risk.
The  University’s  exposure  to  market  risk  relates  primarily  to  its  investments  which 
are measured at fair value through profit or loss. These financial assets are invested 
in terms of a considered strategy adopted by the University Council and the Board 
of  Trustees  of  the  UCT  Foundation,  advised  by  the  Joint  Investment  Committee. 
The strategy takes into account the risk profile of the individual endowed funds and 
allocates  investments  to  appropriate  asset  classes.  Portfolios  are  then  allocated  to 
selected portfolio managers who operate under defined mandates. The investment 
decisions made and performances of these managers are closely monitored by the 
Joint Investment Committee.
The  Joint  Investment  Committee  comprises  trustees  of  the  Foundation,  members 
of the University’s Council and external members with specific expertise relating to 
investments. The Joint Investment Committee meets quarterly and receives reports 
from investment managers on a cyclical basis.
In addition, the Joint Investment Committee has employed the services of an actuarial 
firm,  Willis  Towers  Watson  (Pty)  Limited,  who  monitor  the  performance  of  the 
portfolio managers, both on a qualitative and quantitative basis, and who also report 
quarterly to the Joint Investment Committee. These reports are also distributed to the 
Foundation  trustees.  Internal  checks  are  performed  regarding  the  income  received 
and the purchase and sale of investments as reflected on the portfolio statements.

Interest Rate Risk
The University has a number of receivables (i.e. student fees) that are exposed to interest rate risk. For the 2021 year, students were charged interest at a fixed rate of 1.0% per month (2020: 1.0%).
The University holds a substantial amount of interest-bearing investments and interest earning bank deposits. Interest risks relating to the University’s investments are managed and monitored by the 
Joint Investment Committee in the same manner as outlined above.

23.5  Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss 
for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.
Trade receivables
The  University  trades  only  with  recognised,  creditworthy  third  parties.  It  is  the 
University’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to 
random credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that 
the  University’s  exposure  to  bad  debts  is  not  significant,  and  there  is  no  significant 
concentration of credit risk at year end. At year end the maximum exposure is R222 
million  (2020:  R195  million),  which  reflects  the  amount  after  the  recognition  of  the 
provision for impairment. Refer note 9 for further details.

Student fees receivables
The  University  has  stringent  policies  with  respect  to  not  allowing  students  with 
outstanding  fee  balances  to  either  graduate  or  to  register  for  the  new  academic 
year. The outstanding fees balance at year end is widely spread amongst numerous 
students indicating no particular concentration of credit risk. The maximum credit risk 
exposure for student fee receivables is equal to the carrying amount of the student 
fee  receivable  at  year  end.  At  year  end  the  maximum  exposure  to  student  fees  is 
R253 million (2020: R226 million), after the current year impairment provision. Refer 
note 9 for further details.
Other financial assets
With  respect  to  credit  risk  arising  from  the  other  financial  assets  of  the  University, 
which comprise loans receivable, cash and cash equivalents, debt instruments which 
are  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  which  comprise  government  and 
corporate  bonds,  and  certain  derivative  instruments.  The  University’s  exposure  to 
credit  risk  arises  from  default  of  the  counterparty,  with  a  maximum  exposure  equal 
to  the  carrying  amount  of  these  instruments  R3.5  billion  (2020:  R2.9  billion).  The 
University  places  cash  and  cash  deposits  only  with  major  financial  institutions  with 
good credit ratings.

23.7  Fair Values

23.6  Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations 
associated with financial liabilities. The timing and nature of the University’s cash inflows 
and outflows are such that liquidity problems are unlikely to arise. Furthermore, the 
University has access to funds through either its holding of short-term bank deposits 
or  the  unendowed  investments  portfolio  in  the  event  that  any  unforeseen  events 
occur.  The  cash  flow  position  is  monitored  by  management  on  a  weekly  basis  by 
means of a cash flow statement.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the University’s financial liabilities 
at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments:

largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of financial instruments at 
fair value through profit or loss. Fair value of the unquoted ordinary shares has been 
estimated  using  recent  equity  transactions.  The  valuation  requires  management  to 
make certain assumptions about the model inputs, including forecast cash flows, the 
discount rate, credit risk and volatility. The probabilities of the various estimates within 
the range can be reasonably assessed and are used in management’s estimate of fair 
value for these unquoted equity investments.

24.  Commitments

24.1  Capital Commitments

The capital of the University comprises both restricted funds designated for specific 
purposes and unrestricted funds, being funds that can be employed by Council at its 
discretion.
The University has a healthy relationship of reserves to assets, however it must be 
remembered  that  much  of  the  asset  base  is  held  in  designated  investments  and  in 
property which has restricted alienability.
The University’s policy is to apply conservative financing. Internal loans are used for 
managerial purposes at a rate appropriate to the inherent risk. Debt is avoided but, 
where utilised, the policy is to settle in as short a period as possible, not exceeding 10 
years, except in exceptional circumstances.
In any event, the operations need to generate a sufficient surplus to meet both the 
interest  on  the  debt  and  the  capital  repayments.  This  policy  is  consistent  with  that 
adopted in previous years.
